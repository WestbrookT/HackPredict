The VR Classroom experience is a learning environment that encourages students to pay attention and concentrate in a particular topic by means of virtual reality technology. With the help of interactive avatars, animations, and integrated evaluation methods, among other features, a VR Classroom delivers a particular topic at the time and place that a student is. UserÂ´s behavior in a VR Classroom is used to measure its interest in the class, information that is used to provide feedback and facilitate the assessment work.
VR hardware is becoming a commodity, and therefore it is possible to think on a VR Classroom for every student. VR Classrooms can provide a guided and controlled environment for learning, an innovative way of distance learning, a novel ecosystem for learning experiences. 
As for the milestone 2, we have been working on identifying the focus of attention of a student. We have also explored two technologies (i.e. Mixamo and Faceshift) for capturing facial expressions and recording a class.
