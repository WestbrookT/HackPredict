Lil Big Head is an infinite runner. Using head tilting you control the tilt of Lil Big Head's big head. As his big head tilts from side to side, his balance and his body will move to that side. You gotta try and keep balance while grabbing coins(or something) and power-ups while  avoiding obstacles and avoiding falling off a ledge. I believe this game will work well with GearVR because it does not require any controls other then tilting of the head. I also think this game will be really cute, watching this guy with a big head falling around the level smashing through things while tripping over himself.  
The plan is to begin on a roof top, always running forward, avoiding obstacles and reaching the transportation method to the next rooftop. Rooftop to rooftop will be travelled by wooden planks, or jumps. Once I finish all the assets for rooftops, if there is time I would like to add one or more environments, such as mountain tops, a space station, or who knows what.
Some challenges right now are figuring out the story. A simple idea is that he stole something and he is trying to escape, but that is a little too similar to temple run or the monkey king and many other infinite runners. I wanna think of a better reason for him to be infinitely running, but as of yet I do not know.
Since my first update, I have travelled to another city to negotiate he buyout of my company. This means I have spent less time then I would have liked to on my game. I have still managed to build a basic prototype. and some simple animations for the character.
