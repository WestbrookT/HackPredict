Gamepad:
Left D pad:Helicopter Flight or throttle
3 dot button: Altitude Up
1 dot botton: Altitude Dwn
4 dot button: First person and 3rd person mode- can't fly but can aim and shoot with helmet. (needs more angle and didn't have time for cross hair)
Left trigger: Missiles
Right trigger: 60 Cal guns
Notes for final release build:
*Robot shoots at you, but  needs to be 2 x faster with more damage.
*Ui bar for player and Robot, would have been better fading in and out over Robots Head.
*Buildings can be destroyed but takes way too long; but concept is there to rescue characters at top.
*Players where supposed to get dropped off at sea on boat. (not enough time)
*Characters get on board the chopper. They will wave at you in the back seat.
