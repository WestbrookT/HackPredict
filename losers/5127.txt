I wanted to create something that would let people develop distributed applications without needing access to a supercomputer. But the same applications could then be scaled to CloudLab via GENI.
The cluster utilized the SLURM scheduler and OpenMPI.
It's still up and running! I've thought about how building one could be used as a hands on exercise to teach networking. This project is very accessible, and its construction could be boiled down into something a team as young as 12 or 13 could accomplish it.
