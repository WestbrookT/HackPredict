The quadrupeds at Boston Dynamics were our inspiration in designing this robot.
It has two different walking gaits as well as exact coordinate movement for singular legs
I did the hardware over the summer. It was built from scratch in my basement and we wired and programmed it today.
We spent hours troubleshooting the wiring. In the end it turns out the problem was a bad breadboard. We also ran into numerous programming challenges, most of which were syntax errors.
Honestly the accomplishment I am most proud of was figuring out the breadboard issue.
Our whole team learned a lot about Arduino, programming robots, and electronics.
I definitely plan to add some sensors as well as refining the hardware. After that I plan to optimize the walking programs and eventually get it to climb stairs.
