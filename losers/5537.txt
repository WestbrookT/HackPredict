Running in circles doesn't mean you'll be back where you started in this game, but that's exactly where you want to be.  I want to see what I can do with level streaming in Unreal or Unity to challenge a player's instincts and deductive reasoning to find his or her way through a level that completely surrounds them.  The virtual world doesn't have to mirror reality, and in this game it doesn't.
