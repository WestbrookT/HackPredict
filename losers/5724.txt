The idea came from a picture on the Internet, where a bear protects a little girl from the nightmare that surrounds her. The main feature of the game is the use of the light to destroy the creatures that want to attack the little girl. The game is still in the prototype phase, it will be produced next year by a collaboration of programmers from UQAC, artist from Centre NAD and sound designer from UDM.
