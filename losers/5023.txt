Having had negative experiences with eBay, I conceived that it might be useful to have a simpler "sell things on Instagram" system. It seemed most people relied primarily on photos when shopping in eBay, so more information didn't seem helpful. 
However, I was very frustrated with the challenges and high cost of getting items delivered in Australia, so when the Uber Request API was announced, the penny dropped for me that a simple app to buy and sell things that are nearby and have them delivered via Uber would be immensely useful for people who tend to work during business hours (and therefore always have to take time off work to get packages otherwise).

As there is only one fairly simple purpose to the app, there is no specific user feature to draw attention to: I've worked to try to keep it simple and obvious in how it behaves.  However, I would draw attention to the app's use of CloudKit as a specific way of avoiding complex dispute resolution. Since CloudKit is being used, it's possible to associate someone with their Apple ID and phone, without requiring them to go through a complex signup process. This provides security for both buyer and seller, all while the App itself has no specific private knowledge about the user.
