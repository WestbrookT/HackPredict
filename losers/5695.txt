Welcome to your mind. Rêvasser is a hypostatized environment that is the starting point of a mental journey. It considers the structure and widespread presence of myth in our dreams, and the emotional impact of color to present users with a cyclical interactive narrative via four distinct hyper-immersive virtual landscapes. 
More often than not, our dreams are revealed to us in the language of universal human experiences, condensed in rich, vivid symbols and eternal ancient archetypes. As such, you are introduced to Rêvasser through 'dream conditioning'. Just as one's waking experience might influence a dream, you are presented with 'memories' to carry into your experience, and then a fade to black. A particle system lights up according to biological feedback from a heart rate monitor watch and sounds lull you to a calm, trancelike state. Eventually you are given a choice begin your travels. 
Each landscape is linked to an emotional state that is common in dream experiences such as freedom in a limitless environment, falling, losing control of one’s body, claustrophobia, being chased and flight. The narrative experience is driven along using head tracking and images appear and disappear according to the user’s gaze. 
Rêvasser is unique because although it strives to recreate the dream experience, it also gives its user the opportunity to explore the relationship between our dreams and myth, and opens a forum to discuss the areas where virtual reality and dreaming meet. Einstein once said "Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one". What if an immersive virtual environment can enhance our reality? Can it reveal the illusion of presence in the real world?
