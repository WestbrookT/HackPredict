Windstreams is a beautiful VR game that takes you through a city filled with hot air balloon challenges where points and powerups await you. This game gives you a surreal experience of flying a hot air balloon in a city filled with skyscrapers. You can collect points and powerups as you traverse your way through a series of windstreams. The genre feels like a combination of platformer meets racer. 
There are two game modes: Lap and Free Flight. In Free Flight the goal is to make it to the end target without running out of fuel while collecting as many points as possible along the way. In Lap, you are on a lap timer and try to make your way through the levels as fast as possible. 
This is a totally original game concept developed with the goal of making a VR game that is fun and comfortable for all age types.
This game uses the touchpad of the VR headset to control the fuel that sends the hot air balloon high into the sky. All other movement is controlled by entering and exiting the windstream at precise moments where you can jump from one windstream to another. Be careful of falling into windstreams that will take you away from your course or fade away and leave you stranded.
Keeping high frame rates throughout the game.
