Our team observed that the number of students that apply for the professionals program at pathways has been decreasing. This is a program designed to reward students who act in a consistently professional manner (being prepared, showing respect, completing tasks, not being late, etc.). To become a professional you have this complicated matrix of qualities and teachers that you need to get signed. The root of the problem is the sheets. They are a hassle for students and teachers. We realized that we could solve this problem with an app. This app will allow students to get approved for professionals by simply scanning a barcode that teachers would make available if they felt the student was worthy of the honor.
