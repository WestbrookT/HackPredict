Friend built a light suit but it was rudimentary and hard to handle. We decided to stick to the light suit idea and throw in different modes and music analysis.
It makes lots of flashes and can change modes by interacting with a Pebble smart watch or by a phone app.  It can cycle through different modes that range from preset shows to real-time music recognition capable of immediately responding to audio input and creating impromptu audio-visual experiences.
Science.
Running out of energy
Successfully incorporating the Pebble, Android app, Arduino, and LEDs into a project that surpassed all expectations! 
How to build Android applications, Pebble applications, embedded digital signal processing, Bluetooth integration, how to make cool clocks
Marketing.... and a more streamlined version of the suit. Create buses for wires and better latches to hold the lights on the body.
