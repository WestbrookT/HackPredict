Pantomime Playground, due for release later this month, has been thrilling beta users from 4 years old to 80 with realistic virtual worlds you can reach into with almost any mobile device.
The Playground app for phones, tablets, PCs and Macs includes networked competitive and cooperative games that lets users easily push, knock and paddle objects into goals with their mobile devices. Those devices appear in the virtual worlds -- to other players networked over WiFi, and even in virtual mirrors.
This revolutionary, highly interactive real-time twitch game platform is BEGGING to be adapted to the immersive Gear VR Innovation platform -- so instead of just seeing the scene through mobile devices and computer screens, a player can see a gorgeous stereo view in any direction.
In the process, reaching in with mobile devices enables a new level of interactivity for virtual reality.
