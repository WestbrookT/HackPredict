18% of the population suffer from anxiety related disorders. Many go untreated, many have ineffectual treatments that rely in simple imagination techniques. Imagine how difficult is to imagine your deepest fear. 
Virtual reality is an effective alternative, it has been used in research and health networks for more than 20 years. But, it was cost prohibitive. 
Until now, mobile changes everything.
Mental health professionals such as psychologists or psychiatrist will benefit from an affordable mobile-based virtual reality solution for exposure therapy.
Psious is the tool that democratizes virtual reality treatments using a regular smartphone. Our solution has two important parts, the virtual reality app and the control panel in the web platform. Both are connected through internet. The virtual reality app runs in a smartphone and requires a 3D goggles that the patient wears. The web platform allows the therapist to control what the patient sees in the smartphone and personalize the treatment according to his or her need.
The platform contains a wide range of audiovisual resources such as hyper realistic virtual environments, augmented reality applications and 360 videos. We have also implemented a biofeedback accessory that allows monitoring the stress level of the patient in real time.
