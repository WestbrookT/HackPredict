"Feel the rhythm" is a music game in which soundtrack chosen by you dynamically creates the world around you. We are moving in the virtual space generated based on rhythm and beats. Route, velocity and objects which are shown during the game depend on the soundtrack which you have chosen. We've created our original algorithm to analyze this soundtrack that's why the scene is dynamically rendered during the game. The game is characterized by high dynamics, special effects and possibility to listen to music which you like.
