Rebase is a mobile VR online multiplayer co-op game that tasks the player with defending an island from waves of enemies. This exciting actioner comes with several twists on the genre including limiting the players to melee attacks between manned turrets. Virtual reality brings a fresh perspective to the RTS defense game type with features such as operating turrets with gaze aware aiming and physically pivoting around the island in VR for a "Tiki God's Eye" perspective.
