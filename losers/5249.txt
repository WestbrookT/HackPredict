Stress is the second most reported work-related health problem, affecting 20%/35% of workers in industrialized countries (in 2010, WHO data).
Stress can cause people ill and misery, both at work and at home. Stress may also compromise workplace safety, and contribute to other work-related health problems, such as musculoskeletal disorders. And stress significantly affects an organisation’s bottom line. 
Strategies frequently used to reduce negative arousal include relaxation techniques, promotion of a healthy lifestyle (e.g., physical training), and cognitive–behavioral techniques (e.g., biofeedback, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral rehearsal). Scientific empirical evidence has demonstrated that some of these individual-level strategies – in particular relaxation and biofeedback training - are effective in reducing stress and burnout.
Within an engaging VR Island, the user has the chance to learn and practice effective relaxation techniques. More, it is also possible to use a mobile Heart Rate Biofeedback Training aimed to help individuals in managing and coping with psychological stress. By using relaxation strategies guided by professional narratives and by controlling the respiration rate, variations in the Heart Rate control the features of the virtual environment, like the increase or the decrease of the size of a virtual campfire and of a virtual waterfall.
