Astral project your spirit into defensive towers to battle corrupted creatures of the forest.  Can you stop them before they get to your camp?
Spirit Defense will bring a simplified tower defense game into VR.  Players will be able to gaze at and possess a tower by using the GearVR's tap pad or gamepad to take control of where the tower attacks.  
For an optimal experience play while seated in a swivel chair.
