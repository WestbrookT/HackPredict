The Behemoth Village is an experience that plays similar to a short film. Users will be flown by a mysterious creature to a city that lies on top of a moving behemoth. The experience will focus on a sense of speed, and the feeling of flight. When prompted with questions, you will be able to nod or shake their head to give answers. With a low poly flat shaded aesthetic, you will experience wide landscapes and see imaginative creatures on your journey.
