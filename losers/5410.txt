Space Time Rail Road is your ticket to the Metaverse!   Built on the servicemedia.net platform, STRR is a cloud-based, cross-platform app that aims to make creating and sharing virtual worlds as easy as blogging.  
Users can navigate an array of linkable scenes, populated with streaming audio and shared photos, and interactive objects such as keys to different scenes.  By approaching and touching these keys, and then entering a gate,  the user is transported to the new scene.  Registered users will login to the servicemedia.net platform to create, configure and share these scenes, and upload streaming audio, photos, text content and messages, and 3D meshes, all of which is scattered in the customized environment.
