Shamania is a puzzle game, set in a cartoon polygon world, where solving the puzzles alter the world around you.  Based on the massively popular flash game "Coign of Vantage", and the mobile game "Pixel Twist", it moves the picture-forming game play to the 3rd dimension. By transferring the player head orientation to various 3d warping transforms on a cloud of floating fragments, the player can reorganize the particles into an image or 3D shape. Upon solving each puzzle, the player directly effect their surroundings, transforming it from a simple wooded forest into a magical wonderland. As the player progresses, the forest around them takes on magical properties, warping, transforming and glowing.
Shamania is a game you need to experience to understand. I hope you enjoy it as much as I had making it.
