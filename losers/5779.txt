My mom works for a Homebuyer Assistance Organization and she teaches Homebuyer Education Classes. I found out that there is no website that has all of the upcoming Homebuyer Education Classes. Then, there was no one website that had a list of all of the Down Payment Assistance Programs that are available to Houstonians. So, it was my mission to make a website that informed the public on this information.
In a database I made, there are three tables: one for the organizations, one for the classes, and one for the down payment assistance programs. With PHP, I query the information and post it onto the website.
I am new to PHP, so with the shift from PHP 4 to PHP5 and the use of mysqli, I was clueless. It took a while to find a correct example of accessing a database and querying that information.
I am proud of my ability to persevere through certain struggles. While my struggles were someone else's ease, I know that I am taking progressive steps into becoming a better developer.
I learned more about PHP. I also realized the many parallels between certain programming languages and their structures. I was able to be more creative with PHP (which doesn't say much because I am not the most creative person in the world).
I will add more functions to the website to make the website more beneficial to users such as a form that calculates a users Annual Median Income and Federal Poverty Level and a function that allows you to register for Homebuyer Education Workshops.
