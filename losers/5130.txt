VR Vox is a voxel world building application for the GearVR. 
Lots of work has gone in to the interface to make it as fast, easy and intuitive to build worlds. 
This is the first voxel world building app designed for Mobile VR and not a mod of an existing game. VR Vox is innovative in the tools it provides for quickly and accurately creating blocks. 
By default, the creation of blocks is done along a "Construction Plane". The Construction Plane is a a virtual plane that you can build along that is set in realtime whenever you click the face of a cube. Click then hold to continue drawing blocks along the Construction Plane. Blocks can also be drawn in mid-air using the Construction Plane. 
There are a couple drawing modes that will help you depending on what you're trying to build:
Building in VR requires navigation. I experimented with some touchpad based locomotion techniques, but everything I tried felt weird, was hard to explain, and would probably make  most people nauseous. I found what worked best when only using the GearVR's controls was a teleport option that would simply teleport you on top of a block. When paired with a controller, the ability to fly worked well, but analogue rotation caused instant nausea. I decided to do rotation snaps on the controller, allowing for 30 degree or 180 degree rotation snaps using the right joystick. 
When using just the GearVR, you don't have many input options. To give the user the ability to easily change options I decided to pull up a pie menu when pressing back. The pie menu makes it very quick to find the option you want.
