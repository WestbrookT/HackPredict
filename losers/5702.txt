In this game you control a drunk wizard who has a bad day. He works at a potions factory and he's been doing a dead-end job in shipping. He wants to go into potion development but he was rejected for the n-teenth time, so after a couple of drinks he decided to get his revenge by destroying the boxes in the factory. The goal is destroy as many goods as possible before security is notified. User will be able to level up their magic and learn new spells as well in order to make their spells more potent and destroy more boxes of goods.
What makes this game unique is the skill leveling up system. Ideally the multiplayer should also be unique by creating local co-op in which the other player can join in the destructible sandbox to either help or hinder their friend by using magic to impede the other player or to destroy boxes.
Early challenges are creating a multiplayer system based on bluetooth and creating the initial assets. Another early challenge that the team will face is working with Unity since most of the team is coming from working within Unreal. One of our biggest final challenges is making sure the game will run on GearVR at an acceptable framerate.
