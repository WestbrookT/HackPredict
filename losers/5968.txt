Finding the bell schedule and map were a hassle in school, and the school website is not very efficient as sometimes it is down and it is always hard to navigate on mobile devices.
You can find bell schedule based on which lunch you have and if it is a Wednesday or not, and can access a map of the school with the three major buildings labeled clearly.
Properly formatting the images and making the Wednesday indicator work, as well as labeling the map correctly.
Getting the application to work properly (making the screen to screen navigation work) and posting it to the Google Play Store as it was our first app.
We learned more about app inventor like: proper screen to screen navigation, implementation of images, and boolean variables with whether it was Wednesday or not.
Graphical upgrades, more options for more school related things and a more proper map for the app.
