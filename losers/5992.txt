There are very few apps on the playstore which holistically covered the pre-natal care that a woman might need & so this was pretty much n uncharted territory. Thus, as soon as we saw this theme, a myriad of ideas came to our heads and so we went out and made this project.
It does 3 things:
Implemented the chat and timer sections using php alone (whose code was very ambiguous online. And so this was pretty much my idea in itself).
The various functions related to date and time in PHP.
Well, we have decided we will complete this project outside of this  hackathon too. But we really hope that we win this first.
