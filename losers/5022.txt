As the Internet of Things expands we need an easier way to interact with our technology. That is why Moni is a virtual assistant that learns your language.
For uber we integrated a feature that lets you estimate the time for the next available uber by simply asking Moni "Where is the next uber?"
More features like ordering a uber etc. will come soon.
