We are a team of 2 developers who would like to test our skills in our first VRjam. The game is in an early stage of development and we hope to successfully achieve our goals.
Thank you for the opportunity to let us participate and to all others for tunning in on how the game is progressing!
MILESTONE 2 UPDATE
We finally have our dungeon environments set. 
The game is playable at this stage and you can go through the dungeon deciding which door you take.
We are actively experimenting with lights, props and characters for mobile optimization. 
Our goal is to achieve a nice balance between graphics and performace. 
We also want some NPC characters in the dungeon for additional interaction/hints on gameplay to the player.
Next we are fine-tuning the gameplay mechanics for you to see next week!
MILESTONE 3 UPDATE
After doing some intensive configurations to our recording software, we managed to successfully
record everything for you to see.
The game has some slight additionall visual polishing ahead to be done, to feel just right. 
After some playthrough testing, the game question-mechanics works just like we wanted.
Whole gameplay session will be ranging from 4 - 10 minutes depending on time takes to complete the questionnaire/form and answer to all in-dungeon questions.
We also want to have some more animated NPCs,  with text-dialogs popping up randomly and some 
additionall rooms to add to the overall scaryness.
Thank you for  following us!
... and Good luck to other GameJam Participants !
