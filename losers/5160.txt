You are at the center of an immense dome of light, with a highly polished floor at your feet.  You are free to look all around, and as you do so you can paint on the dome's surface.  And when you are done you can go to the next frame and paint again, until you have an animation that completely surrounds you.
Circumpaint was designed to work with either the GearVR touchpad, or the Samsung EI-GP20 controller, both under Kitkat.  It was built with UE4 4.7.
Circumpaint has a central UI panel that contains all of the tools and actions you need to produce your work of art.  You may access the UI panel at any time by pressing the Back button, or the 2 button on the EI=GP20 gamepad.
Along the left are the predefined color palettes you may choose from, and switch between them at any time without affecting your art.  Just to the right of the palette are the current color swatches.  The topmost color is drawn by holding down the touchpad on the Canvas, or pressing the 1 button on the gamepad.  The bottom color is available by pressing the 2 button.
Next are the drawing tools: pencil, eye dropper, and paint can.  These are the standard tools you would expect, and make use of the touchpad, or 1 or 2 buttons to draw with.  Following these are buttons to clear the Canvas according to the current colors, or black.
To get help with the controls at any time, click on the green question mark button.  The UI panel may be closed by clicking on the red X button.
Circumpaint primarily uses gaze to determine where to draw on the Canvas or which buttons to activate.  However, it is possible to disengage the current drawing tool or crosshair from the GearVR's gaze by using the gamepad's Left Thumbstick.  This allows you to look independent from where you paint.  You may switch back to gaze control by pressing the 4 button on the gamepad.
Circumpaint takes full advantage of the full 360 degree viewing and control capabilities of the GearVR in order to allow you to produce unique art.  Not only does this work with stills, but also animated works that surround the user.  Circumpaint is a unique application in the current Mobile VR space.
