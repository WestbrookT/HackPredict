The experience we are creating depicts an alien world through the eyes of a newly hatched bird. After a tumultuous departure from the nest, you find yourself in a free fall and must quickly learn to fly to avoid plummeting to your death. Upon learning to fly, your goal is to steer yourself through a vivid and dynamic environment to reach safety on the ground.
With this experience, we are aiming to create a stylized environment that proves that photo-realism is not necessary for effective immersion and presence in VR. We are experimenting with hands-free control methods that feel natural with the Gear. The main challenge we are looking to tackle is creating a fluid and intuitive experience that anyone can be immersed in, regardless of prior experience with gaming or VR.
