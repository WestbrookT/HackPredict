I got tired of reinventing client-server communication and state management.
Nbdl manages application state for you and will provide a simple interface for rendering data any time it is changed. It also will provide a layer of validation and filtering that is run on both server and client. It is still a work in progress.
It is written in C++ for the sake of being multi-platform. Use in browsers will be accompolished with emscipten, but there will also be thin clients for lightweight applications.
