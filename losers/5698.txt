(Codename) "Broom Broom Broomstick!"
aims to allow players to experience what it would feel like
flying around on a broomstick.
The Game will feature 3 modes:
• Free Roaming
• Find the orbs (collect all the orbs dislocated around the map)
• Catch the Snitch
I am still working on the third mode as I am figuring out how to implement
a "snitch" element that flies around the map. The idea is that a snitch will be flying around
and once you spot it, you can start chasing it to catch it.
BBB will possibly feature different maps and broomsticks on which you can fly on.
My vision for the game is to see it grow and evolve to a point where one day you will be able
to fly around with friends and compete in multiplayer modes.
