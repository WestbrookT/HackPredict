When i started my own startup, i was testing & using several video conferencing systems. As developer and professional, I wasn't satisfy using these tools. So, i decide to build my very own conferencing system back in 2011. To achieve my goals I started using node.js in 2012 and today i am proud of building from scratch about 10 scalable and responsive applications that work on many devices. This application is one of them.  I learned the hard way how to implement firebase & WebRTC APIs to work together in one project . What you can build with these tools is only limited by your imagination.
