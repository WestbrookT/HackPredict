PeekaBoo
Imagine being able to experience a 3D short film from the inside! Our space-age Kinder Beans are enjoying a typical, quiet day at school until the teacher is called suddenly away. As the students enjoy a short break
from the watchful eyes of their teacher, their creative explorations lead to hilarity and mischief-making. How will the little beans ever put the classroom right again before the teacher returns?
Take a Peek into their world in this one of a kind fully animated experience.
