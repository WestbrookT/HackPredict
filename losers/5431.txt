Controls - The app is a shooting game. The app uses the head tracking and the touch pad. When a user moves his/her head, a airplane in the app also changes its direction. So a user feels like he/she controls the airplane. Also a user can shoot a missile by touching the touch pad. 
Mechanics - We try to bring an airplane simulation into the Gear VR. A user can experience a wide sky in the app and moves an airplane as he/she wants. A user feels he/she is in a battle field while avoiding enemy airplanes missiles and shooting them down! To clear the game, a user needs to destroy a boss, a big ship in the app. We hope a user enjoys our app.
Innovation - My team focuses on creating a comfortable and realistic experience. It was a challenge to minimize the VR sickness. We adjusted the rotation speed of the airplane and limited the rotation range of the airplane. A user immerses oneself in the VR environment with our app. We also integrated AI for enemy airplanes. The AI brings more thrilling experience. 
Thanks for everyone and our team members. We finally finish the project! 
It's an awesome experience to participate the jam.
