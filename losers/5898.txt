Sample online tutorials, brainstorming
Alerts the user of a house break-in using a touch sensor (in substitute of a proximity sensor which was unavailable). Alerts user by playing a loud noise off buzzer, flashing alert message, and sending a text message.
Built entirely in Arduino IDE, the text messaging service was setup through Twilio
Setting up constant loops checking for input of intruder, getting lcd screen to change background colors, and to setup a reset function (never was able to complete) 
Building and developing a hardware-based project from start to finish 
How to use Arduino and grove kit sensors, Twilio integration with Arduino,  and how to code C/C++ within the Arduino IDE
Reset function so project doesn't need to be compiled every time you want to use it, integration with a mobile device application.
