A controller is optional.  The user can take a guided tour with no controller, and also freely roam the painting using a controller to explore, discover, and frame their own view. 
The experience is set in an environment from the period when Bosch lived and painted - his home town of Den Bosch and his studio.  The user can either sit back and enjoy a guided tour, or also use their controller to explore the painting in detail and make new discoveries.  A guided tour and narration gives the user more insight into the painting. Users can hear the sounds of the people and creatures in the painting, reinforcing the painting scenes, and have a sense of being closer to Bosch's creation. They can perceive more of the painting than ever before due to the close scrutiny, image detail, view controller, unity of environment, sound effects, and music.
