Crooked News is a Chrome Extension that will notify you whenever you have stumbled upon a "news" website that is deemed untrustworthy.  When a time where the average consumer is overwhelmed by clickbait, biased articles, rumors, and conspiracy theories, Crooked News makes it easy to quickly differentiate fake or "crooked" news from trusted sources.
Crooked News was developed by computer science students Triston Simons (Temple University), Chris Till (Rutgers University), and Tim Smith (The College of New Jersey) for ProfHacks 2017 at Rowan University.
