Every single member in this group was new to android development when the weekend began. Most of us (3 out of the 4 team members) had never worked in java before either! Our goal for the weekend was to learn as much as we could about android development and java in the time we had- ONLY 36 HOURS! It was a fun, challenging, and rewarding weekend; we are all very proud of the effort we put in and the product that came out of it. We created a timer that counts to 50 minutes (in our demonstration one it only counts to 10 seconds to show what happens at the end, but the 50 minutes is coded in the comments). At the end of the 50 minutes it randomly selects one of the 11 switches that will tell the user what kind of break to take. The reset button starts the timer over and the exit button closes the application.
