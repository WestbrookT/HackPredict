Promotion of Codeutsava and our interest in creating something new. 
it provides all basic  information to students,parents and teachers about the latest education system. Gnyan is a platform which makes it easy for user to find all resource at same place and saves times.
We used basic html and css in our program.
being 1st year students and not having much knowledge about complex programming we faced several issues.
This is our first website that we created.
we learnt team coordination. How to set different effects in website.
Still now we prepared only front end of the project but now we will try our level best to develop back end also in our website.
