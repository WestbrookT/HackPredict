Linearity is game about using your head to draw lines through notes interspersed around you in a 360 degree sphere.
A line is being drawn from the centre point of your vision which, for each node you look at, it clicks into place and
draws a line from each to each. 
The object of the game is to maximize your score by quickly deciphering the right node to draw the next line to and make the correct patterns. 
A few potential game modes are:
Color based: Each line changes color to match the  last node it touched, try to maximize score by creating streaks. 
Shapes: A floating simple shape could be drawn in front of you and if you make the shape with the lines you get bonus points. 
Absolute : A maze, there is only one valid node from your current location to the target. Try to hit all the nodes as fast as possible. 
Rhythm : The nodes change colour with the beat. How does that effect play?
Tetral : When you connect 3 or More they "Pop" and are replaced with new ones. 
The Mechanics are simplistic, they require no buttons,or at best 1 button. Allowing for simplicity and easy for new people.
It is a gamespace in 360 degrees and so it avails of VR as a mechanic, not just as a display medium. 
It should be small, fun and competitive. 
The overarching goal is to make something family friendly, competitive, bright and easy to pick up.
