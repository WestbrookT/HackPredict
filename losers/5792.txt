The system uses Facebook's SDK to pull recent comment threads from a brand's Facebook page. Individual users are extracted from the thread and analyzed for individual voice. User scores are then combined with other indicators to create sortable "top5" and "bottom5" of impactful comment threads. This allows the brand representative to identify comments on a Facebook page that have been generated by influential users, sorted based on their sentiment-score (a combination of pos/neg and various Facebook participation metrics that correlate with impact and reach).
