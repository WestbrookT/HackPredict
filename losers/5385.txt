The Temple of the Swamp Giraffes is a classic rail shooter with a twist- you're goal is to find the collect the souls of all the priests who died in the swamp.
The player has full control of their sight, but no control over their path- allowing them to focus their attention on the beautiful landscape, unsettling architecture and mostly spotting and collecting the lost souls. The collection mechanic involves the player focusing their eyes on a lost soul in order to harvest.
There will be three stages of difficulty, where difficulty is scaled up by increasing the speed at which the player moves through the swamp.
