We decided to make a game centered around an inside joke on our floor.
You use the WASD keys to move the vacuum cleaner around, to chase and attempt to catch the figure.  As you catch figures, a new one will appear.  This will continue until time runs out.
We didn't know any HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, or how to use a Google API, so we had to start from scratch.
The game works.
We learned how HTML, JavaScript, and CSS work, along with how to use the Google Maps API.
