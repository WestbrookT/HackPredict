In Vrisör, you can take the role of a barber (Swedish: frisör). Don the barber’s hat and style a virtual character’s hair with different hair styling tools, such as scissors, blowers, sprays, and pincers. There’s also supposed to be a final tweak that will enable you to admire your work and share the fun with others.
The graphics will be kept simple. Assets, avatars and particle-based hair will be used with standard shaders.
The game interface will be kept simple. No graphical user interface is planned, the experience should be intuitive and with a self-exploratory touch. Your only motions will sliding (on your virtual barber’s chair) around the character, and you will be able to look from different perspectives and mirrors.
The selection of tools and their interaction with the avatar / hair will be based on real-time animated hands. How to best control these hands with the mobile controllers allowed for the VR jam will be the main challenge of this submission.
Final word before you take up the razor: you’ll not be able to get points for the best hair style (yet), but we hope you’ll have fun with this VR experience!
