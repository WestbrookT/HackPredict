As a Production Engineer its always a challenge to automate application stack bootsrapping from scratch which involves provisioning of the server, dns entry updates, Cluster/loadbalancer udpates, app setup per Env etc. We're trying to solve this with a complete automation in place using opensource technologies.

We could achieve a good progress on complete automation with just one day. We realised that this can be made even more beautiful with improved error handling

*DNS entry addition automation
*Choose a better inventory management software (with apis) to store the states of servers.
