As some of you may know, citizen’s say within an election is a great problem. This was proven with the most traumatic and recent election. The next president of the United States of America is officially Donald Trump. Now in this election, less than half of the U.S population voted. This shows that the election itself is lacking the say and opinions of others.  Some don’t care what the outcome is, others don’t know about voting, and some even lack the knowledge of their own community. Thus, advertising companies are not efficiently spending their funds on areas of a community where the citizens will vote.
What our team has done, is create a map that displays what percentage of the population, within each Ward, actually voted, of those who registered to vote. For example, let’s say a Ward had 1000 casted votes, but only 800 had registered. This shows that a greater amount of the population voted. Now advertising companies know how to efficiently spend their funds. 
30% voted = red
31% - 70% voted = yellow
71% - 100% voted = Green
Those sections of the Wards that have less than 30% of the registered citizens voting, we would strongly like to implement an education program that helps citizens to learn more about voting, the process, the different parties, the pros and cons of a specific leader, and most importantly, learn the history and background of a community. This will raise the voter percentage, and so advert companies can spreads their funds to more citizens. And so, more citizens have a say, know what they are doing, and contribute to the future of the economy of the City of Waterloo.
