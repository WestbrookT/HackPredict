View all your current loaded phone videos in a VR Room at once. There you can browse and Select from them to view on a giant screen.   All videos under your "My Videos" folder can be displayed at once and sub folders can be entered using doors on the VR Room floor for navigation.  
Currently have a proto-type running but still working on the following challenges:
Need better performance
Need to be able to load all videos dynamically.  Right now we are loading each video staticly by hand.
