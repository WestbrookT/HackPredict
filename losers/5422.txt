In the game, you control Clover, a pioneer flying cow set to aerial adventure through local countryside (much to her Farmer's annoyance).
To start playing, look at Play button and tap the touchpad.
To control Clover, just look where you want her to fly.
There's no actual gameplay yet, but you still can enjoy being a flying cow floating through countryside.
