This game will combine the common gaze shooter with multiplayer action. Two (or more) players will spawn in a random location on a map and will take turns that will be divided into two parts. Part 1: teleporting, a player will be able to teleport a set distance every turn and will try to position themselves in an advantageous location. Part 2: firing, after teleporting the player will be allowed 1-3 shots with varying power that will be aimed by their gaze. The power of the shots will be determined by user input via the touchpad or gamepad. Search and destroy, sneak and ambush, wait and watch, lure and trick. Whatever way you choose to play the game timing and accuracy are king!
Most of the time so far was getting familiar with Photon and synchronizing the location of each player and their shot across the cloud while keeping data usage to a minimum. Basic pixel art is in development but we won't know how far we can push it graphically until we do our benchmarks this week.
