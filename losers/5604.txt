The journey is an experience at sea, but you have no control of the route the boat will take!
It begins as darkness has fallen. The moonlight is obscured by heavy, rolling clouds trying their best to keep the sea in total darkness. Rain continues to pour down, unforgiving in its assault. 
Before you, a large shadow appears. There is no mistaking the overwhelming carcass of the once feared and bountiful ship - The Dark Curse. The light from your lantern barely shows the wreckage, but shows enough for you to navigate around it. The ship moans and creaks as the sea continues to herd it into the rocks it has settled on.
Your boat is minuscule in comparison. It rolls and rocks aggressively as the current guides you through the wreckage, sailing over its once mighty deck. You are on a journey over which you have no control.
In the distance, land is visible but it does not appear to be welcoming. There are little signs of life and the coastline is jagged and dark. There is no way back as the current urges you towards the land and surely follows the path of the bountiful cargo lost from the Dark Curseâ€¦
