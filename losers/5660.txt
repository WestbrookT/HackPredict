VIVA will create a 360-degree virtual tour of landmarks and national monuments in Washington, DC. Locations will include sites such as :
• Lincoln Memorial
• Washington Monument
• Korean War Memorial
• World War II Memorial 
Our goal is to bring the viewer into a high-def, immersive experience for an up-close and personal look at the beauty of Washington, DC. Not only will we guide you through historical sites, but we will integrate interactive elements along the way so that you can control where you look and what information you derive. Our virtual tour can be used as a learning tool for students in history or politics curricula, or simply as a way to transport anyone into the heart of DC on demand. 
In the image gallery you will find three screen shots of a 360-degree experience of Israel that we created for a recent event. This was a wildly popular exhibit amongst attendees of all ages, and we plan to take our Washington DC virtual tour to the next level with high quality video. We have also added a screen shot of our progress as of 4/27 (Screen1.jpg).
