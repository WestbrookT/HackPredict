Dream Example(Doors)
When walking through a portal or doorway from another dreamstate, the player will step into a hallway where they will hear the air conditioner running on high in a long empty corridor. Hearing doors open from one direction to the other, they will be able to see someone or thing running between doors.

To travel up and down the hallway, there we will use the google street view method of ground based directional arrows.
