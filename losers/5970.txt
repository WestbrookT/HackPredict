I wanted to make a small project, I wanted to work with Processing some more but I wanted to make something that had meaning. I thought a lot about how much time we spent on social media - how there were a lot of programs that expressed this but at the detriment of the individual - that is the focused on how many people you were reaching with your tweets rather than how much you were tweeting and its association to your life. 
Then I got the idea of visualising your time on social media as an electrocardiogram to get people to think about their lives and how much social media was a part of it literally and figuratively.
