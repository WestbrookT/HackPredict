Shopping at retail stores is generally terrible. It's difficult to find a staff member, and once you do they don't know your preferences and fail to personalize your shopping experience.
Shopkeeper aims to solve these problems using Gimbal beacons, Nexmo, and a store's API (in this case, Zalando).
Shopkeeper will scan for a store's Gimbal beacons, which can be strategically placed to serve as a 'virtual sales assistant' in each department of the store. After a beacon is sighted, Shopkeeper loads a helpful interface recommending items based on the department and customer's purchase history as well as allowing the user to request a staff member with the press of a button.
When the button is pressed, Nexmo is used to notify a representative.
The internet connection made it nearly impossible to download dependencies; we had difficulties finding a phone with a high enough API level to test on; when we did, the OS got corrupted and bluetooth stopped working; None of our team had ever worked with Android before  
We managed to get it to work (pretty much).
Basic Android UI structure, sometimes bluetooth piggybacks off of Wifi drivers on smartphones, shopping is cool
It's scalable - the idea can be used for any physical store. 
It generates revenue - customers who otherwise wouldn't be helped by a staff member can receive shopping guidance.
It optimizes employee resources - staff use their time much more efficiently by helping customers when they need it.
It has low overhead cost - Gimbal bluetooth beacons are extremely cheap to deploy.
