The game concept is simple, tried and true. But VR changes everything. In a Tron-inspired reboot of the classic Asteroids, the user finds herself transplanted into the Asteroids universe. Part of the power of very simple graphics is that our imaginations fill in the lines, and lines will define this experience as well. Rather than a fully textured, realistically-lit world, Vasteroids! dispenses with the uncanny valley by exploring the space of "retro" graphics in VR space. Your childhood arcade machine has come to life.
