This is a virtual reality museum for stolen and looted artwork. 
As the user strolls through the museum, an audio tour plays in their headphones, telling them about the pieces they are viewing. Allowing the stolen artwork to be seen by the public is a way to restore cultural artifacts and history that have essentially been erased, due to theft; this also improves chances of recovery. If the user recognizes any of the pieces outside of the museum, they will be able to report it through the app. All artwork is dynamically loaded from a database generated from an art recovery registry.
The project was originally designed for the Oculus Rift and we'd are now porting it to GearVR. This new iteration will involve revision and updates to the design and functionality, which will result in a more complete and working product.
