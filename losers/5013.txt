I'm new to programming and Bar Roulette is my first app. I recently signed up for a programming class but was struggling to think of a final project. When I read that the Uber API now had ride requests I knew exactly what I should build, Bar Roulette. 
A big struggle some nights (and afternoons) is picking a bar to go to. I often end up going to the same spots. Bar Roulette is how I fixed that and added some excitement to picking a bar. All the user does is enter in their location, the app then picks a top rated bar in their city that is open and sends an UberX to pick them up. If UberX isn't available in their city a Black Car is sent. The best part is the user doesn't find out what the bar name is until the ride has completed and they have arrived!
