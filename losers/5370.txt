Detective is a game with a pretty simple concept: When you open the game, you will have to wait for a second player – or a Robot – to join in. Once that happens, you will be randomly assigned a role of a Detective or an Impostor. If you are the Detective, you have to ask your “partner” questions that will help you figure out whether you are speaking to an Impostor pretending to be a Robot or an actual Robot. As an Impostor, you have to answer Detective’s questions in such a way that he or she will think that you are a Robot, which – and here’s the twist – is a chat bot.
The technical side of the project was pretty simple. The biggest challenges were: making the chat bot look more like  a human being -- and getting enough players :-)
