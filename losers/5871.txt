We're programmers at a mobile dev shop, and everyday we have to struggle with our project management software.  We wanted to solve a problem that caused us to be less productive and more frustrated.  We didn't want to make another app that had to be downloaded by everyone before it became useful.  With PUSHPIN, only the project manager needs the app to create and manage projects.  The members of the project can provide updates through SMS by using simple commands.  Several seconds later and you'll be back to work!
