We port players down to atomic length scales to freely interact, and build with atoms and atomic systems from simple molecules to nanobots. This app will serve as a starter application on the GearVR that we would like to integrate with a full PC game where we gamify the process of becoming a Nanoengineer to allow players to create meaningful and novel atomic configurations by we simulating them in game. We are currently working on the artwork of harmonic quantum energy configurations of atomic systems, the  frameworks converting of geometric text data to GUI, and refining the efficiency of our back end physics simulations.
