It uses a global input controller so it can be controlled using an Xbox/bluetooth controller as well  
The environment features props, which players can use to their advantage in combat. For example:  
There will be clusters of asteroids and abandoned remains of space stations floating around which will damage the spaceships on hit. Some space stations also fire plasma that will decrease the players heath if they are hit. Players who are confident of their maneuvering ability could lead their opponents towards them so that they could get a kill without having to fight them.  
Innovation: A space game when played in VR Is a lot more immersive and enjoyable than on 2D screen. We have created beautiful skyboxes along with various particle effects to fully immerse and awe the Players. Head tracking will allow the player to look around the 3D space intuitively. The perpetual tumbling of asteroids towards the user creates a great 3D sense of space. UI cues for the health bar and also audio cues in the form of explosions and missile launches add to the immersive experience.  
VR aims to transform the user to a different dimension and help experience a game close up and more personally. So, this game is perfect for a group of gamers to compete against each other in a fun and immersive environment.
