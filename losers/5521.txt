Defensive Strike is a tower defense game where the player will be an active participant in the action. In addition to controlling the game like a traditional tower defense game, the player will have the ability to move throughout the field of play and attack.
The game will combine the strategy aspects of a tower defense with the mobility and action of a first person shooter.  I think the Gear VR platform provides a way to extend the tower defense genre with the ability to immerse the player in it. What I am attempting to do is have a game that is more than a gaze shooter by allowing the player to explore the battlefield and be an active part of it.
I need to work on the sketches, but I'm thinking with some assets from the Unity Store, the screen shots and game play will look good.
Milestone 2 Update: Working with some assets from the Unity Store, I've not put much customization into the sample that I'm working with. I'm running in to some problems. I have had a prototype running on GearVR. This next week will require a lot of work.
