Open data exists but is difficult to access and not exactly user friendly. We wanted to give people access to this information without creating another standalone app that would be cluttered with the rest. 
Todaytum is a web-based interface matching trending topics in the news with visualizations generated by contextual data sourced from the government. The news is the context by which users are able to interact with the data in hopes that they will draw meaningful insights from otherwise unusable data
Created during the CODE 2015 competition, having only 48 hours to ideate, iterate and build was our biggest challenge!
Todaytum placed in the top 15 in the Canadian Open Data Experience [CODE2015] 
Embrace the skills you have to add value to any dev project, be prepared to make changes and move in new directions, add value to your idea by expanding it into various channels where it will get noticed!
Todaytum is looking to further refine its algorithms, integrate more data sets and eventually explore B2B and B2C opportunities
