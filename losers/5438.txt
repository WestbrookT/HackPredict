Dream Diaries is a procedurally generated journey through a player's subconscious inner world. 
Every experience is different as players become lucid in these worlds that create themselves at random in front of the dreamer's eyes. 
Beds become magic carpets, office hallways turn into endless labyrinths, and the dreamer changes from one form to another, sometimes a human and sometimes an animal or other times even appearing as an inanimate object. Many great surprises await anyone willing to close their eyes and follow their dreams.
