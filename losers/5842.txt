to get history from taking a photo of a historic landmark
when you take a photo, the GPS location will take you to a page with old photos of the building and a little history about it
We used android studio to build the app with GooglePlaces API for the GPS, Picasso for the Images, and Camera API for the camera.
Most of the team members were brand new to Android Studio.  We struggled for four hours to implement a swipe that ultimately didn't work.  Our proposed functionality was beyond our capabilities.
We were able to access the GeoLocation, use the camera, switch between activities, and implementing Picasso.  
We learned a lot about the structure of SML files.  We learned how to use APIs from reading about them.  We learned how to work as a team.  We learned that we should make our plan more achievable for our capabilities.
User Interface improvements and implementing a real data base to make it extendible beyond our hard coded land marks.
