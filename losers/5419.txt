In keeping, MasterStroke is designed to be an exceedingly comfortable experience – from its leisurely rhythm and roots in familiar summertime fun to its unobtrusive UI and optional mid-flight chase camera. What’s more, the depth of MasterStroke’s gameplay presents what we feel is an outstanding venue for new users to gradually and pleasurably ease into the locomotive complexity of virtual space. 
We hope you enjoy MasterStroke.
