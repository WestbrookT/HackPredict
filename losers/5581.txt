If you remember any of the ice-puzzles from 2D top-down games (like the Pokemon caves) where you take one step in a direction and then slide until you hit a wall, this would be like that, but in three dimensions. By looking at a wall and selecting it, you can make that direction down and fall to it. The puzzle rooms would be voxel/grid-based and the goal would be to get to a particular place in each room. I haven't tested this in VR yet, but there is the potential that rotating the world around you to reassign which direction is down is not comfortable. If I cannot find a way to make that comfortable, this project will be modified or not completed.
