This game tells a story about an accident happened while the astronaut was checking a broken satellite, a worm hole suddenly appeared and began to inhale everything nearby. The space station began to transport several circle-shaped stuff called RING which enable the astronaut to accelerate and escape from the worm hole.
In this game we will provide the player a capacious universe space, as a great feeling featured by VR hardwear.
To play the game, take a single tap on the touchpad and the charactor would launch the jetpack. Beware of the oxygen usage, every move in the space would cost about 1/10 of your total oxygen, so aim right at every RING as once you missed some of them, the game will soon over.
