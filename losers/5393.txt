’Clean Up!‘ is a Hidden Object Game using VR. 
Using Unreal Engine technique, this game’s background is a 6 or 7-year-old girl’s room. It’s purpose is to organize stuffs by a Cross hair at the center of a screen, 
using a little Gaming Controller to move inside of the room.
We are going to develop the game as follows;
We’ll furnish a room like a princess living in it, using pastel colors.
It’ll will be filled with a lot of toys about 70 to 80.
It’s goal is to find every things in a room in 5 minutes. 
There’ll be a whiteboard at the center. 
Then, a player looks at it and finds them as fast as he/she can.
Player starts at a center of the room, but they can move. 
Considering a level of difficulty, some stuffs are difficult to find 
because we are going to place them all over the room.
UI is made of objects placed in a game. 
For example, Hidden Object Game shows 
a list to find at the bottom area of a UI, 
but we’ll replace with a picture and arrange them on the whiteboard.
Through this one, we’d like to make a game that fascinates people interested in Hidden Object Game, and helps them to enhance their concentration by finding character’s items one by one.
