This is a simple Django 1.7+ project template with my preferred setup. Most Django project templates make way too many asumptions or are just way too complicated. I try to make the least amount of asumptions possible while still trying provide a useful setup. Most of my projects are deployed to Heroku, so this is optimized for that but is not necessary.
