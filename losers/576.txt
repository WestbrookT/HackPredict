The inspiration was because one of the kids on the team really wanted it for his D&D club at school, since dry-erase boards designed for purpose can be quite expensive.
It generates a grid based map with various terrain objects. It is designed such that additional features can be added at a latter date. (Such as the die roller which has already been implemented)
It was built in java over the course of a 12 hour hackathon. (Though we did loose an hour trying to get git hub better)
I accidentally set everything to the same object one time which caused the project not to work correctly among many other things
I wrote part of a program along with a great team and we worked together really well. Also this is good group development project since we are all on our high school robotics.
How to use swing for Java as I was not familiar with it before this project.
We are going to implement more and more features such as drag-able character location markers and other things of the same sort. There is also room for better graphic design and more graphic options.
