Imagine a world where gravity is something that is a lot more variable than what we experience in our everyday lives. Where slight movements might force you to reconsider what you think of as down. This is the world of Gravitational.
Gravitational lets you experience the properties of gravity in first person in a fun and immersive way. This is accomplished by putting the user in a universe where planets are orders of magnitude smaller than in our solar system, while gravity stay at the level we are used to here on earth. You can walk around the full circumference of a planet in less than 10 sec. Interestingly, jumping in this universe can easily make you escape the gravitational field of a planet and fly into space. This enables you to jump from planet to planet and explore the universe in a new and interesting way.
In this world, you assume the role of a shepherd. You manage a herd of space creatures that must feed on grass to survive. The goal is to survive as long as possible. The resources of a planet is limited so you have to travel around the universe to find more food. You do so by "throwing" your creatures between planets (while you yourself jump).
Your creatures will multiply if they are prosperous, creating cute baby space creatures.
A big focus in the game is to make the user really like their creatures. The user can interact with them in multiple interesting ways. For example, by picking up grass you can make the creatures follow you around. You can also pet your creatures which makes them happy, which in turn makes them more likely to reproduce. We are thinking about incorporating leap motion for the interactions.
In addition to being an interesting and unique experience, we believe Gravitational can have educational value. By letting students experience how gravity behaves first hand, we hope their intuition and understanding of gravity can increase.
