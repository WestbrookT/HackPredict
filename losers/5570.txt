The map screen for this game is represented by various locations in a dusty old comic book shop. Individual levels are selected by looking into the issues of the vidHero comic that you find laying around. Each comic issue offers panels explaining the level, story and relevant game mechanic(s). Once you start a level (by looking at the last panel long enough), you enter vidHero's suit and use its powers to execute the plot for that issue.
