Dancing is something that is slightly embarrassing for people who don’t posses the dexterity it takes to perform complicated dance moves. When people hear / see musical performances they enjoy it’s nearly impossible for them to keep their heads from moving. We are taking advantage of that compulsion and creating a VR application that turns head movements into a competitive skill to be practiced, shared and enjoyed. 
Scoring in Project Headbanger depends on two factors. Accuracy and Style. We will make sure we are teaching users how to move their heads in way that is enjoyable and perfectly synched to the media we are displaying. At the same time we will give them opportunity to move the way they like to. We will give them an opportunity to dance how they normally do...as long as it’s on beat. Scores should be varied enough to allow for a wide variety of point totals so that ties won’t be likely.
