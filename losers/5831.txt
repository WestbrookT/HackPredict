We needed it at NewSpace.NYC to do diligence for companies entering our incubator.
We use FullContact API to get a person's social accounts, scrape those, process them through personality insights, and result a due diligence report. 
Our first API choice (ClearBit) didn't return the data we needed. 
Our team is good people, good times. 
More bluemix, more watson, more fun.
Continue scraping more and more info and build out the report's thoroughness.
