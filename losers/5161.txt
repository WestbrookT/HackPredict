echo takes you inside of a bat out on a night's hunt. In this VR experience, you'll use echolocation to navigate the world around you: manuever through trees on mountainous terrain, explore a labarynth of stalagmite filled caves, and hunt for your night's meal.
For the first time ever, we're one step closer to experiencing how bats and other sonar dependant creatures navigate the world around them. As you step into a new way of sensing your environment, you'll find yourself developing techniques bat's have long since perfected.
