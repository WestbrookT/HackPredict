WHEELS is a fast-paced kart racing game featuring four tracks: A calm cliffside, a wintery forest, a stormy volcano and a physics-defying road in the clouds.  The game puts you in the seat of a racing kart, where you will face off against eight AI controlled opponents in a frantic race to the finish.  Racers will be able to pick up various items to help them overtake their foes and win the race.
This game works surprisingly well in VR, as you have your kart as a point of reference which helps alleviate motion sickness, and the simplistic graphics style helps to make the game run well on the mobile platform.  I also plan to have some items that will utilize the headtracking, such as a 'laser' guided missile.
Multiplayer is something I would love to include - however due to time constraints it is very unlikely at this point.
Milestone 2 Update:
Currently progress is coming along - I am running into a few problems (for example modelling the characters), however this is only due to my ZERO experience with 3d modelling before this VR Jam, I'm very happy with how I've done so far with the track models and I should be able to get something for the characters soon.
I still need to program the items, such as missiles, bear traps and what-not, but I have developed a really nice way of choosing a track, the main menu will disappear and you'll be floating above an island, looking down at the island will display names of the different tracks, and upon choosing one you will fly down to it, loading the level.
Milestone 3 Update:
Missiles are in and I'm pretty happy with how they've turned out, there will be some variations such as a headtracking-guided missile and a standard homing missile.. I've also added the bear-trap item, I've been working on the levels still and the AI work, getting them to use items, etc.  It's all a slow grind to the finish here, just hoping that I can get everything done in time!
