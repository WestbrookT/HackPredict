Concept:
Stand inside a photo realistic house and change the furniture and color schemes.
Interaction: 
Moving around the house will be achieved via teleportation to minimize user sim sickness.
Changing furniture will be done using gaze interaction and a circular menu.
Technical challenges:
To use gaze interaction to switch between 3d furniture pieces will be an interesting challenge. I believe that look to select can be a very smooth experience if done right. 
The real challenge will be getting a photo real interior running on Gear VR. with light baking this can be possible with minimal drop in detail.
Current Progress:
3D Model Done
UI up next
