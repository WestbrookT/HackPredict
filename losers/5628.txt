Toonscast is a fun immersive weather forecast experience with 360 degree exploration of weather through time. The viewer is surrounded by a 10-day weather forecast, each day being represented as a floating toon island with the weather of that day shown and animated over that island.
What makes this experience unique is the fun and immersive aspects of it. instead of looking at a boring list of days with weather text and icons, users can fly through days, explore different locations, and being transported into a day's toon island to live through the weather of that day.
