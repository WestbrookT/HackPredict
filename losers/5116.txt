La Vía Láctea, or Milky Way, in a way  closely related to the Luis Buñuel film is an Oculus Rift experience meant to give us a unique glimpse into the mysteries of the universe. It will begin in Mexico's recently inaugurated High Altitude Water Cherenkov observatory (HAWC) gamma rays observatory located in the Sierra Negra of Puebla. The experience will first set up a guided and all access guide to the observatory and the scientists that built it and conduct experiments daily. It is through these experiments that the experience takes an incredible turn by allowing the viewer to become the particles and gamma rays that cross the universe and hit the array of 300 containers filled with ultra pure water and rigged with photosensors that capture the 17,000 cosmic events that  HAWC registers EVERY second of EVERY day. Over 500 billion events a year that produce big data sets that can yield a deeper understanding of our universe. It is through this poetic yet educational Oculus Rift experience that we hope to bring to the user a sublime experience which goes from the informative to the surreal.
