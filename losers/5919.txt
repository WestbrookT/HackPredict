We all have personal goals. Whether it's becoming a full-stack web developer, running a half-marathon, reading more books, writing more often, or becoming a better cook, however, "life" often gets in the way and we end procrastinating on what we would love to achieve.
Completing goals is often easier when structure (making a habit out of spending time on your goal) and community support is there to help you out when you get stuck.
Being able to support a cause you care about is just the icing on the cake.
