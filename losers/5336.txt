It's in the woods, it's wet, there is an old abandoned cabin that has forest is slowly reclaiming, but the items inside from the previous owners remain.  You are in the valley with nothing but a list of items you need to find to bring back home.
UPDATE:  The game is controlled with any standard bluetooth game pad.  The player can use the left and right joystick to move the character around but only the left control stick is needed for player movement.  Please remember small movements of the joysticks go a long way.
UPDATE:  When playing you will notice a paced day/night cycle.  You will notice variable wind conditions throughout the level.
