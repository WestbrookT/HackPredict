StarGazer is an ambient experience where players illuminate the night sky with beautiful stars. As a five-minute meditation, StarGazer is at its greatest as a soothing relaxation session after a long day. Players activate stars and link them by gazing at the night sky to draw constellations with a simple tap of the touchpad. When glanced, each celestial body makes serene musical sounds.
StarGazer is meant to be something that is experienced multiple times, with each subsequent playthrough bringing different paths for the player's interactions to take.
