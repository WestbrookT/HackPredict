Go allows users to request the fastest and cheapest ride to wherever you need to go. As young professionals, services like Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, etc. provide a great alternative to cabs. Go provides a singular platform for you to compare and select the cheapest ride share available closest to you. 
The idea of Go came to us on a Friday night before we were headed out to grab some drinks. We looked to get an Uber, but it had surge pricing at the time. Subsequently, we wanted to get a fare estimate from Lyft to see if it was cheaper but Lyft didn't have that capability in the app. We ended up spending an extra 15 minutes trying to figure out the cheapest and the fastest option available. Time that could have been spent getting an extra round at the bar. That's how we got the idea of Go. A singular mobile platform to compare and request the best ride share option available.
We are working on features including the ability to schedule a pickup and avoid surge within Uber, these features, in addition to the already singular platform for requesting ride share are the ones we are most excited about.
