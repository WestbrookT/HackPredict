We text parents FREE tips to help prepare their kids for school. 
Each week, we present weekly activities tailored to your child's unique development by text.
These are fun and effective activities that develop children's literacy skills and help parents create language-rich, nurturing and responsive home environments.
How does it work?
Our team of scientists, educators and technologists design easy to learn and effective parenting strategies based on insights from research in neuroscience, cognitive psychology and early childhood development.
Each strategy is broken down into fun and easy steps.
Every Monday we send you a text personalized for your child's needs.

Ultimately, we will allow social service providers, schools, pediatricians and care-givers to have two-way, gig-powered interactions with their clientele.
