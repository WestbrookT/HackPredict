my friend/team-mate  lyle always faces this problem while driving. Since, he also has sight problems he experiences glare extensively
when two cars in approaching in the opposite direction, either one or both cars are on high beam,then car1 would cast a shadow on the wildsheild,of car2, only  around the driver's region of car2.and the vice versa can also happen. We replaced headlights with projector lights to make this hack work.  
to detect a pair of headlights coming from the same vehicle/car.
accomplished my challenge, by incorporating many conditions.
smarter,effective and easier coding in matlab
add in more features, like detect rain,dust etc, and make it more efficient
