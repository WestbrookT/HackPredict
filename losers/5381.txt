In a galaxy not too far away... You are part of a documentary crew on an expedition to a newly discovered planet full of vibrant life. It is your mission to record footage of the never-before-seen creatures and terrain. A heads up display keeps the controls simple and free-flowing. Your vehicle, POD X, gives you a craning point-of-view for smooth cinematic shots. As you progress, your abilities increase and you are able to use more complicated camera techniques. Don't worry, you receive help along the way and are guided through your out-of-this-world safari! 
As you leave the newly discovered planet and reach orbit, your footage is cut together into a one minute documentary with accompanying voice over and sound effects. You are graded on framing, recording efficiency, curiosity, and creatures sighted.
