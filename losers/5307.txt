This week I finished the sound effects and music.  The uploaded apk is now available to download.
The basic gameplay is now working and running on the Note 4.  Next week I will be adding a soundtrack and finishing up the gameplay elements such as showing health and level statistics. If time permits I hope to add some interaction with NPC's along with a quest or two.  The video was recorded in the Unity editor because device recording has not worked out for me so it's hard to get a real feel for the game form the video.
You came from the stars and have lost 8 of your fellow star people. They were captured by the Humans that inhabit the planets in the Sol system. It is your task to rescue all eight of your lost family so you can return home. 
A controller is required to play the game, each type has different button mappings.  The buttons enable you to view your health, swing the sword and sprint. A future final version will have a controller setup option, for now they are hard coded to fit a Nyko bluetooth controller.
The purpose of this project was to see if it was possible to make a first person RPG game in VR without the nausea. I think I have succeeded by keeping the assets simple and the level sizes small.
