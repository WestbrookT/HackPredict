My roommate saw a TV show where SMS was used to launder money among prisoners. I was inspired.
Do simple money transfers as well as participate in micro-lending transactions through SMS.
Created some MySQL tables to simulate a legitimate banking system (accounts with balances);
Used Twilio API to make calls to our server written in PHP. 
Never used Twilio API. No experience debugging something that isn't a webpage, console app.
Verification system for transactions.
Accompanying mobile app to better facilitate micro-lending.
