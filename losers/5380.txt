In A Darkened Room follows an interrogation with a person who has supposedly committed a series of crimes but cannot be pinned. Waking up in a dark room, you find yourself in front of a laptop and a flickering light. A deep, male voice chimes in and begins requesting information from you. You must reply to the interrogator's questions by using the laptop as your mouth has been taped shut. Different answers produce different outcomes. Some may be beneficial to your situation and others may have deadly consequences. Experience everything from a first person perspective and be immersed with vibrational feedback.
