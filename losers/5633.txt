You are the brave spartan that was murdered at night by a cowardly traitor.
You need to escape from the underworlds guarded by crude Hades and his minions to avenge your death and warn Sparta. 
Luckily you have a magical grapple hook, that will help you get out.
Player needs to guide the hero using Gear VR motion tracking and built-in touchpad. When player will touch the touchpad, grapple hook will be ejected in the pointed (by look) direction. 
When hooked, player will swing from one side to the other until released by touching the touchpad again.
