Plexus is a VR maze game like none before it. You play as the rightful heir to Castle Kingdom. Manolo the Evil magician has cursed you into a labyrinth known as “The Plexus”. In order to break free from the curse you must navigate through the maze and get to the end of the plexus. The Plexus is unique in the way that it allows you to navigate through the maze. There is no need for a gamepad to navigate so the game is universally available to anyone with the gear. No gamepad required. Swipe forward to move a step forward and tap to jump and get a quick birds eye view of the entire maze. Tilt left and right to avoid holes and death orbs. 
Aside from being able to jump and get a quick birds eye view of the maze the player will be guided by a voice (child's laughter or monster, not sure yet) the voice will run across, behind, and both sides of the player to signal which way to move through the maze. A different voice will follow the player from behind getting closer as time moves on prompting the player to rush.
It’s entertaining, immersive and competitive in that it has a high score function. Some of the challenges we need to solve involve the jump tilt functionality. We want to make sure that the player is able to quickly get a brief full view of the maze every time he or she jumps to help them navigate forward, but we want to make sure this jump is not too abrupt and doesn’t cause motion sickness. Because the art we are planning for the level is complex we are not sure if we should start with just one maze and make increasingly difficult mazes or if we should just stick with one really complex level.
