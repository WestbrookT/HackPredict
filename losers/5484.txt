High Concept
In Space Jam, you’re Old Granny Smith – a seasoned space pirate. Known to pirates across the galaxies for her fruit jam, she’s scored the mother lode by harpooning the cargo bay door of a transport ship that just happened to be filled with TONs of fresh fruit! Flying through the low orbiting debris field left behind, Granny collects various types of fruit floating in space to make her jam! But the airlock is broken so the only way to collect it is by smashing the fruit on the windshield, and using her old automated Windshield Matter Delimiter 3000, which vacuums up the fruit smashed on the ship’s windshield.
Gameplay
The player flies a space ship collecting fruit to create jams.  This is done solely by using the VR headset to steer the ship into the fruit, where the ship will collect the juice.  While collecting fruit, the player must also avoid space debris that will impede their progress.  Once a set amount of fruit is collect in a level, the level will be cleared and the player will move on to the next level.
The Challenges
Since this game jam focuses on mobile VR, one of the challenges of developing for the platform is the wealth of different devices that need to be taken into consideration when developing.  Because of this, we are developing the game based on the idea of only using the headset as the controller.  Since adding buttons or a controller limits the devices that this game could be played on in a mobile space.
The other challenge with how we are making the game is with slamming the ship into the fruit and passing other objects.  The concern is whether it will negatively affect the player i.e. vertigo and finding ways to keep the gameplay interesting, while keeping people from getting sick.
