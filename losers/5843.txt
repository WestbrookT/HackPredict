Farm Fresh Food!
LoCal collects information about the local farms in the area, the produce they provide and presents it to you in a web app. LoCal can show you the nearest farms, the produce that they make and generate you recipes based on what ingredients you added to your shopping list. It also takes your shopping list and shows it against Canada food Guide Data.
