Astrologly is the first AAAS (Astrology as a Service) application.
We're disrupting the divination industry through offering elegant, REST-like APIs on top of deep occult knowledge graphs.
We are dedicated to our craft and practice Taurus-driven development (TDD), a software development process that relies on the Taurus's slowness to anger and sensibility in practical decisions.
Base Endpoint:
https://astrologly.herokuapp.com
API Key:
Your API key is determined by taking the MD5 hash of the year, month, day, and military time of your birth, encoded in url-safe base64. MD5 is totally secure because it is an irreversible hash. Rate-limiting will be determined by the Quincunx aspect of your API key.
