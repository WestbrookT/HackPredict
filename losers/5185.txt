HereÂ´s our Build for Android!
 
2 Weeks before the jam has begun we have pitched some of our ideas to ourselfes and we decided to do do a journey game with a budgie. 
On first day of the jam we started concepting the first impressions und ideas. 
We worked as fast as possible and where able to present the first prototype of BIRDFREE! on Milestone 1. 
Now the prototype has evolved into a playable game with an amazing immersive feeling and headspinning heights.
We are designing our game with the Unreal Engine 4,
because of the Blueprints, the visual scripting language included. This empowered our artists to participate in the gameplay design, events and mechanics.
