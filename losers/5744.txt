Working with travel leaders' data, using their API is challenging and also interesting tasks.
It provides much better user experiences than any other booking websites.
The only challenge for us was the limit of the time. Other hands everything is possible.
We are proud of the whole project.
Probably the next steps is to clean up a code a little bit, however it's not that bad at all.
