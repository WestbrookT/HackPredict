A first-person RPG/shooter with citybuilding aspects and a light-hearted sci-fi feel. Kind of like a more casual Borderlands with a splash of SimCity Buildit. About 20-30 minutes of gameplay in this demo.  
An electrical storm destroys your spaceship and fries the jumpgate back to Earth, leaving you adrift in space with just your grappling hook. You'll have to make friends, battle raiders, and collect or mine resources to powerup the jumpgate and return home.  
The movement mechanic is to use a grappling hook to move and swing in zero gravity from asteroid to asteroid.
Only the headset touchpad and back button are used.  
All player movement is driven by the hook/recoil/release mechanic. The other main loops are resource collection, mine building and upgrades, combat, combat upgrades, and NPC quest completion.  
After a short intro scene (in which your ship explodes and strands you), the gameplay narrative moves forward with NPC quests, which compel you to collect crystals from space, build mines to collect gold from asteroids, and complete special missions like the turret mini-game. The game is also peppered with combat zones, which will allow you to collect more resources from loot drops, though they may also cause you to bleed resources if you get into too much trouble. An upgrade menu allows you to spend resources on stronger weapons and shields, which becomes necessary as the game moves forward.  
• Several NPCs will give you quests to complete, driving the gameplay and narrative. The super-objective is to collect enough energy cells to repair the jumpgate home, which can only be obtained from NPC missions.    
• Mines can be built on special asteroids. They have a max capacity, which forces the player to return and collect the produced resources before it continues production. Capacity and production rate can be upgraded.
The main innovations are the zero-gravity grapple hook locomotion and the fact that many conventions from other genres (campaign FPS, city building, adventure) have been well-adapted for an accessible VR experience.  
• The grappling hook mechanic is the sole method of locomotion, providing a balance of control and accessibility (no gamepad needed; can reach more users). The player automatically slows before they float too far from a grapple anchor, removing the need for artificial level bounds.  
• Player controller rotation is frozen on the X and Z axes, and changes in direction are gradual to prevent motion sickness.   
• UI design had to take alpha overdraw into account for a smooth experience, which required designing in a way as to provide as little UI information as possible at any given time.
• The game is ready to scale, as all major systems are in place for a large quest-driven narrative in the vein of many console FPS games. Unique locomotion, a full quest system, a combat system with weapon/shield upgrades, and a mining/resource management system.  
On a side note, as a developer with zero 3D art skills, this project's visuals were brought to you by the Unity Asset Store, ha.
