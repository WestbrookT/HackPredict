Musical Island
Our project acts as a piano tutorial where the player learns through mimicking presented tunes. There are three songs, each progressively more complex. In this way we aim to grow the skillset of the user. In addition, this piano is presented through the medium of an interactive story in which Elton John, our dashing protagonist, finds his way off of a dangerous, secluded island by summoning the powers of animals through music. Collectively, we improved our ability to understand and implement HTML and Java syntax, store variables across different HTML files,  integrate audio files into javascript, and generally make simple text-based adventures more complex and more intriguing. During the brainstorming process, we decided to make a text-based adventure. This medium allowed game formatting as well as an educational component which would allow the user to grow their knowledge alongside a beloved character.
