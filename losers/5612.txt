This project aims to bring a shared, table top gaming experience to old friends and anonymous gamers alike by placing them together in a virtual space and providing them with card games and board games built upon a common infrastructure.
The full vision of this project would see virtual spaces exist between 1-16 players. Gamers would be able to select a game and enter a themed environment suitable for the game they are playing. Examples include a casino for poker / blackjack, a tree stump by a river for chess or a warm living room for Dungeons and Dragons.
As a commercial idea the full product could either have players joining for free and being able to play a few games with additional game engines being sold separately or the game could have a simple and a pro version, where the pro version allows technical gamers to script their own games using the game board toolkit.
The prototype would aim to present the idea with a relatively simple game such as checkers or maybe poker. The following milestones are goals for the prototype.
