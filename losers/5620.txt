Ninjas Vs Samurais will place the user in a Japanese 3D home where the user has to protect the house from invasion. Hired by a wealthy family this ninja will use traps, weapons and magic to defend against waves of enemies. User will have the ability to level up traps, weapons and abilities. Levels become more difficult as player advances. Current difficulties include first time game development, working with Unity and Blender etc. The samurai character will likely be replaced so that the game appears less violent/gruesome to the user.
