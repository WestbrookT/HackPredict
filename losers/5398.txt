A heroic martial arts master flips through a huge multi level burning building to save children. A local news helicopter catches the heroic footage live on camera. This arcade style platformer, leverages the full immersive spectrum of the game’s virtual world, but in moderation. The unique implementation of this game’s mechanics mitigates the need for users to make large disorientating twists and turns to effectively play and navigate the game.  What’s most useful about this game, is users focus less on adopting the play mechanics, and more on the immersive experience of the VR technology. The goal is to provide the end user with an instant action packed VR experience, without making him or her think too hard.
