This is an exciting interactive story, along the lines of "The Walking Dead", but with a focus on VR: A truly engaging first person, visceral experience. You play a bonds trader named Martha. You've made too many bad choices and your job and marriage are falling apart. On the morning of September 11, 2001 you arrive late to work at the World Trade Center and barely escape destruction. You now have the chance to start fresh. What do you do?
