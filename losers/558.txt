Using a water rocket to get a lifeline to a drowning person.
It is a water rocket with a handheld launcher that propels a life line to a considerable distance. It can potentially save the life of someone who has fallen into the water - off a boat, or from the rocks, or who is caught in a rip, or someone being swept away by flood waters.
We used Blender and 3D printing to construct the part. The rocket nozzle  and release mechanism was constructed from hose fittings.
Getting the rocket aero-dynamics right too some experimentation. The release trigger mechanism also took a bit of trial and error to get right.
Original idea. Designed and built from stretch in two days at Hackagong. 
How design and build a water rocket and launcher.  
We are already working in RocketLine Mark II - bigger and better!
