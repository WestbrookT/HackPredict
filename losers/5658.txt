An ordinary day turns extraordinary when, while sitting at your desk, you become suddenly aware your surroundings are just slightly different than they were moments ago.  The feeling is undeniable, the truth unavoidable.  Being a smart person who has read plenty of Sci-Fi, you quickly decide you must be slipping between dimensions for reasons yet unknown.
Although you may now traverse between the dimensions at will, this state of being has left your consciousness spread dangerously thin.  You innately know you can not ignore this.  You must orient yourself in each reality by spotting and observing the subtle differences, easing the strain placed upon you, before it's too late and your mind is forever shattered.
