I intend to record impulse responses with a binaural dummy head in a room with stereo speakers and use these to map stereo sound files into head-tracked binaural output on headphones. The room in which the recordings were made will be recreated in VR and the viewer/listener will be placed at the location where the dummy head was for the recording. Video playback and modeled sound fields are beyond the scope of this demo, but would be interesting to attempt.
