Inspired by all the great places of science fiction, this app will be a 3-5 minute tour of a massive cylindrical space station.  Rather than doing a 360 video, this experience will be actively generated with sight and time event triggers.  The objective is to produce an environment which maximizes the sense of awe and presence made possible through VR and provide an outlet for other future tours.
I'm not a programmer so implementing any of the interactive elements will be both a challenge and a great learning experience.  I want to create wildlife for my biome and have it react to the gaze of the viewer, either evading or approaching to provide some dynamic elements to the tour.
