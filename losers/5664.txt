We've all played Hold'em online with other people.
In VR, with voice, we'll be able to provide body language and voice queues that will allow you to "read" your opponent.  You'll be able to see when they check their cards or who they're looking at.
Chips will be issued to each player as they log in to a room, and of course, no real world value will be exchanged.
