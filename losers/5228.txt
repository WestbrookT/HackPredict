Game Back Story: 
In the not so distant future, the Earth’s core starts to emit a radiation that targets human DNA and kills after prolonged exposure.  it has also shifted the earths atmosphere!  You can see much of the earth from the sky, without having to leave the earths atmosphere... HOW COOL IS THAT!    To survive, humans are forced to live on man made floating cities in the clouds… Islands in the sky.  It is a dangerous world where competing factions battle for resources, airspace and salvage.  You must defend your Floating island at all cost.  You will explore the skies to find resources to salvage from abandoned islands, scout for danger, and eliminate threats to your floating island.  You will play in both wide open skies, as well as inside complex structures.
Gameplay: 
The game will use a traditional pitch and roll control for the aircraft.  The player will also have use of projectile cannons to shoot down enemies, as well as a thrusters button to seed up your craft.  Travel to different locations (long range travel) will be made through portals generated by your floating island.  This is done to mask the obvious limitations of the mobile platform in regards to level size.  Moreover, terrains are limited to short spaces confined to each floating island, again in order to manage the capabilities of the mobile platform.
Finally, your craft is equipped with a small teleport beacon.  The craft drops a beacon with the press of a button, which can persist for a limited time and is only usable to a specific range from the craft.  If the pilot presses the beacon button again, he gets transported to that spot instantly.  It is a perfect way to escape being chased, or avoid an unintended collision.
