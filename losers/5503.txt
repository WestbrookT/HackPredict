Undergrowth: City of Sand is an action-adventure with puzzle-solving elements, based in a world where water and plants are far and few between. However, deep beneath the shifting sands, a deadly jungle rapidly grows, threatening the existence of the world above.
While Undergrowth plans to use the Gear VR to create innovative game play, with a primary focus on puzzles and item design, the main source of innovation is with the game itself. With a world full of rich and diverse characters; a fun, cube-based art style; and randomly generated dungeons; Undergrowth: City of Sands will challenge what people think of phones as a gaming medium.
