Gaze shooters are a common feature of VR games. How about a VR game where you don't want to shoot the thing you're looking at? Your gaze destroys whatever you look at by turning it to stone, making it decay, sets it on fire or makes it explode. Avoid the temptation of looking at cute puppies to keep them alive. Burn down houses, cause horrific car accidents, set trees ablaze, anything to keep the puppies alive, who are constantly trying to get your attention by doing tricks, leaping up to lick your face, climbing on the environment, sneaking up behind you and flying in on their helicopter tails.
Game ends when you have killed too many puppies. End score will show how much monetary damage you caused to save how many puppies.
