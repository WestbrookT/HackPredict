A blob is a large inflatable ballon placed on water.  Someone (preferably large) jumps from a height and fires you up in the air before you land arms and legs wailing in the water.  Blobs are rare to come by and always have HUGE queues so it's a super obvious VR experience to make so everyone can enjoy the fun.
I wanted to make it super light hearted and having a granny as the main character that you play as seemed the obvious choice. As well as playing as Granny you can also play as the guy who jumps from a height onto the blob and watch the granny get thrown into the air, arms and legs sprawling everywhere.
