Ever in a location where LTE/4g data is sparse? Don't have a smart phone and can't afford one? Tuber is an HTTP server that utilizes Twilio, Google Places, and Uber's API that allows users to request an Uber ride via SMS. Simply text a number with an origin and destination, and we'll use natural language processing via Google Places to determine where you are, where you need to go, and send an Uber your way after following a very simple on-boarding flow.
Working around OAuth 2.0 without having the ability to redirect the user to a URL to authenticate was essentially impossible to work around. In order to deliver our proof of concepts, we manually stored OAuth access keys to communicate with the API. Basically most of the problems we encountered revolved around the lack of a web browser. Fortunately, hacky workarounds exist!
Having a working product that will actually let you use Uber without the web if it was connected to the live, production environment is pretty sweet! Moreover, making the web/new applications accessible is really enjoyable both as a challenge and as a service.
