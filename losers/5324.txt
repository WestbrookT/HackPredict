Usually, sales for new real estate projects start before construction is completed. Therefore, buyers cannot physically inspect the houses and apartments they intend to buy. Currently, they base their buying decision on floor plans and a few rendered images. Yet, most buyers lack the architectural background to understand floor plans. They cannot imagine how the rooms will finally look and feel. Rendered images hardly help as they cannot create a holistic atmosphere. After all, they are limited by only providing 2D representations of selective views. Concluding, real estate project evaluation remains a black box for many buyers.
