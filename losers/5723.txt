We set up multiple HD wireless cameras and streamed the content to an off-site server for storage and playback. This was made possible through the increase in bandwidth provided by the Gigabit Internet connection. The team used the ZoneMinder tool (Linux ffMPEG) and PHP programming. The demo was taken down after the event. Adam Hahn and Sarah Sellers did all the work - I'm just the scribe. :-)
