In Bad Dream you will need to avoid horrible things found only in your nightmares while solving puzzles to escape the bad dream! Each level will be a new bad dream with new enemies to avoid, and a new task to complete, and just like dreams, each new level in the game will have unexpected twists and turn. Bad Dream makes extensive use of the Oculus positional audio to help you pin point enemy locations and to increase the creepy atmosphere! Bad Dream is heavily influenced by old school Sierra and Lucas Arts video games, we are using a modified version of the familiar point-n-click based system to interact with objects and the enviroment.
