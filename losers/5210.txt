We also wanted to build something cool with Unity 3D and VR that was simplistic, intuitive to play, but also fun. We decided to create a game that showcases flight - and the feeling of weightlessness.
The user flies around the scenery using his head position to navigate (they move towards the place they is staring at). Floating collectible yellow boxes can be seen throughout the scene, as well as a score counter that increments for every box collected. The boxes respawn at random time intervals after their collection for infinite gameplay.
We used Unity 3D version 5.5, with a Google Cardboard Headset and a Samsung Note S4. 
The "player" would fly through the terrain as if it did not exist during the initial phases of development. We spent a generous amount of time figuring out how to perform this collision detection with the terrain.
The game is fairly intuitive to play, and quite captivating due to the immersive VR experience. The speed of the player is also calculated using a function that results as the solution to a logistic growth differential equation.
We earned significant Unity3D development skills, such as keeping track of time to spawn elements, collision detection, and other neat stuff. We also learned that VR is quite attractive in terms of game development, and that even the simplest of games can be quite captivating.
