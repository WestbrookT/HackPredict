You are an undercover cop with X-Ray vision in a crowded public place.  A crime will happen today.  This crime involves someone delivering a package to someone in a public place.  You must look around your surroundings to see if you notice anything suspicious.  You need to confirm the crime is happening by seeing the contents of the package with X-Ray vision triggered by tapping your visor.  Once confirmed, you can signal the police to apprehend the suspect.  The only problem is that the criminals can detect if you are using X-Ray, and will flee.  So your objective is to sneak X-Ray scans at people's packages to verify the packages and spot the criminals.
This game is unique in that it uses the player's vision as a mechanic, but not as a turret shooting or other similar style of game.  It's about being sneaky and observant.
