The VR/Exposition exhibits the work of 15 contemporary artists. Together with an Art Partner, VR/Heroes is investigating new ways to connect the real art world to the virtual world.
The current exposition that I am working on is a demonstration of how the expositions of the future might look like. In this exposition a combination of 2D, 3D and video art is being used to show the different ways that art can be shown. 
In the art houses can use a VR/Exposition in order to display the art they have on sale. Furthermore museums can use a VR/Exposition to reach the world with the art they have in possession. 
The VR/Exposition is an experiment, and therefore the input & feedback of both those working in the art industry as art enthusiasts is an important part of development. The ultimate goal is to increase the interest in art both off- and online.
