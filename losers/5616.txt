A Terrible Thing to Waste is a Virtual Reality Adventure game that puts the players in the role of a medical researcher tasked with retrieving lost memories. Using the Gear VR as a futuristic machine, the player enters the mind of 79 year old Patricia Simmons in order to help her remember past events.
Virtual Reality presents a unique opportunity to place players in impossible environments which will be presented to the player as a series of puzzles. Starting off in appropriately scaled, familiar environments, the player will be introduced to progressively unfolding, increasingly bizarre spaces. Unlike standard adventure games, experienced on a flat screen, the player will need to use the entire 360 degree environment around them to gather clues and solve puzzles. Maintaining a centralized position, the player can use their sense of place and perspective to sort through and manipulate impossibly constructed dream spaces and optical illusions to complete the tasks given to them.
Since most players will experience the game isolated and wearing headphones, extensive use of ambient dialog and audio will be used to set the scene of being inside a medical facility and will be used to sell the fantasy as an individual using their machine to complete the memory operation.   
The game uses the default controls available to the Gear VR headset and will not rely on external peripherals. The game will take place over the course of three memories and is meant to be played over a single sub thirty minute session.
