The Science of Simulated Motion will be an educational experience explaining why people get motion sickness. We will illustrate our points with the use of 3 motion scenes and informative media clips. 
Scene one will have the user standing at the side of a building looking towards the ground before they jump off. This will simulate falling from heights.
Scene two is on the bridge of a ship as it battles through rough seas. Sea Sickness
Scene three is a Roller Coaster because we all love coasters :)
Our narrator will be humorous in the style of GLaDOS from Portal and will be voiced by Sandra from Virtual Reality Reviewer.
