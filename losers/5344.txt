A bluetooth controller is required for this game.
Have you ever wanted to fly a quadcopter?
The flight controller for the quadcopter is based on the real thing,  so after playing you'll be able to fly the real thing!
How to play
Once you've got the hang of it you can land on or interact with the objects that have blue cubes spinning around them in order to do the time trial.
To refer to the controls (and pause the game) push the start button and look left.
