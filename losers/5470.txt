Harmony is a virtual reality meditation device which prepares a way for spiritual opening. By unifying a unique blend of guided meditation, biofeedback, and virtual reality, Harmony imparts a new approach to meditation and virtual reality.
The chakra system, more than just an assemblage of energy centers located in the body, is a profound system for spiritual growth and a reference to the sacred architecture of which we are embedded. The function of the chakras is to draw in this Universal Life Force Energy to maintain spiritual, mental, emotion and physical health of the body in balance. 
Taking the ancient Vedic and Tantric philosophies from which chakras emerge, and creating a new model within the mode of emerging virtual reality technology, this project provides the opportunity for modern technology to reveal an ancient, underlying, profound system, and a platform to aid meditation on each of the seven chakras.
