Swirling stars against thick blue paint, oily roads across waterlily ponds and dadaist non-sense are all around. Burning giraffes, dancing ballerinas and modern art convertibles will be our guides in this fantastic journey.  
Imagine Monet, Dali and Warhol had the technology we have today.
Soon available on the AppStore for iPhone 6 and Zeiss VR One!
Technical info:
Most of the scenes are generated procedurally. Objects and effects are placed randomly. While working most of the time on rendering issues and visual optimization, I hope you will find my app enjoyable and entertaining. Please forgive me for the unfinished state.
*Requires full Unity3D 5 SDK support
