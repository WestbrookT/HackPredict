The consumer user experience on Healthcare.gov, an online insurance marketplace central to healthcare reform, is significantly broken. Consumers must sift through endless forms to answer even basic questions about what coverage options exist and how much it will ultimately cost their family. We want to change that.
We are connecting people with great local healthcare coverage. We see a future where our users have access to insightful tools and millions of cumulative reviews of every local healthcare coverage available from HealthCare.gov, from primary care, dental to drug coverage and more. The information provided is valuable for consumers and small business employers alike. Our business revolves around three key constituencies: the consumers who use our tools and read the reviews, the contributors who write reviews, and the healthcare insurers that they describe. 
Leveraging IBM Watson's Tradeoff Analytics on IBM Bluemix, the current iteration of PlanAdvisor helps consumers make clear choices about what Healthcare.gov health plans will meet their family's unique situation by combining smart visualization and recommendations for tradeoff exploration.
