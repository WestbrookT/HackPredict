Time Spy is a game where you are placed into a complex busy scene of a city sidwalk. People walk busily around you, scyscrapers hang ominously overhead, and somewhere, somebody is watching you. Using the Gear VR trackpad, pause, rewind, or fast-forward time to find the spies who wish to extract your position and identity. You can also use the trackpad to zoom into the scene and uncover clues to the location of the spies (footprints, leftover equipment, escape routes, etc..).
With this mechanic I believe I can leverage the trackpad combined with looking in a completely intuitive way, allowing new users to pick up and play with a simple in game tutorial. 
The scene you'll be in will be like a Pixar version of The Matrix sidewalk scene. You'll be scrubbing back and forth through a total of 60 seconds real-time, but those 60 seconds will be packed with interesting and subtle details.
