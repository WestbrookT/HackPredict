We were inspired by the technology of 3D scanning. And its many practical uses in prostheses, object detection, security scanning, SLAM problems, and other space mapping applications.
This pan-tilt mechanism uses microservos to sweep a 3D area. Because the infrared sensor is facing forward, its input can be converted to a distance away from itself. 
The laser-cut fixtures hold the servos and Sparkfun Time of Flight sensors in place while the Arduino microcontroller commands the infrared sensor to take in values. 
Challenges include designing the fixture to fully account for the servo's movements, and displaying the output data in an aesthetically pleasing way. 
We got a moving mechatronic system! We are able to display the infrared output, horizontal angle, and vertical angle, too. 
Lasercutting
We would display the output data in a better way.
