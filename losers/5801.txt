People are different.  Why should we read news or information that doesn't inspire, provoke or soothe?  We wanted to create a simple tool to help tune the feed of information a person reads or watches by leveraging insights gleaned from their personality.
Good.News leverages the Watson Personality API to analyze the personality of authors, speakers and bloggers from notable publications and the Alchemy News API, to generate psychographic profiles for each author and organization.

Media Feeds are then optimized by FitScore™ and users can easily surface content that might either  or .

Testing around the system showed that if you can supply Watson with this minimum, you can fairly confidently arrive at the same profile for that author using disparate sets of articles.
