We all know that we're living in the 3 dimensional world. But most of people don't understand what it is.
So I want to show people what is dimension. Not just telling about it but also show it and give an experience about dimensions. 
The contents will be made with two chapters. 
The first chapter will explain about dimension to people with showing animation about what is dimension. Such as 'What's difference between dimensions?' or  'How a point become a cube.' or 'Why are we seeing the world as a 2 dimension?' etc.. And then go to the next chapter. 
The second chapter will show the world of flatland( wrote by Edwin A, Abbott). 
'Flatland' is a story of flat people. There is a flat square, or triangle, or circle. The main character is a 'Square' who living in the 2 dimensional world. Meet the 3 dimensional creature 'Sphere'. After meeting Sphere, Square understand the existence of other dimensions. 
The reason I choose the Flatland. To make people experience the world of other dimension. Not just watching the Flatland but also experiencing it. Being a Flatlander like a Square. Seeing the world with eyes of 2 dimensional creature. or 1 dimensional creature. or they can affect to the 1 or 2 dimensional creature. It will make people easy to understand about dimension with more fun way. And make them think about upper dimension. such as 4 dimension. 
Finally showing the tesseract (4 dimension alanalog of the cube) with 3D graphic. And explain about why we can't imagine about 4 dimension world.  And all the contents is over.
