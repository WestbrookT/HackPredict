The Captain took your ducky! He kidnapped it from its beloved pool and brought it far away to a dry and uncomfortable place. You, a super strong hero who cares a lot about his ducky, start to chase the kidnapper. Your little quack needs water, and you shouldn’t leave a stone unturned. Literally. In worlds of hexagonal platforms, you use your strength and brain to get the water find its way to the rubber ducky’s bathtub. Solve complex puzzles by rotating single hexagonal fields, or use complex mechanisms and gears to shift whole bunches of hexagons. And if nothing’s working, use mechanical tools in the environment to your advantage.
Head tracking controls in combination with either the touchpad or a gamepad.
Later on, when the worlds become more complex, use the power of elements and benefit from their physical strength. Let wind boost windmills at a suitable place  or combine water and magma to create upflowing steam. Different elements used in the right order or in combination, lead to new elements or usable effects.
Does a wooden dam prevent you from guiding water to your ducky? Burn it down with the nearby volcano, then let the water find its way.
Does a canyon prevent you from guiding water to your ducky? Direct magma into the stream of water to create steam. Rising steam builds clouds in higher plains, which can cross the canyon and make it rain above your impatient ducky.
