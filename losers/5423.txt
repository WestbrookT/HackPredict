The player pilots a giant (relatively speaking) toy robot and must defend the toy city from king-sized monsters bent on destruction. The player controls the robot remotely from within a circular room in a tower called “The Panopticon” located in the center of the city. The player can look out the windows to see where their robot and the monsters are. Spread out underneath the windows are all of the robot’s controls. The controls are placed randomly each game and may not be in the same position as the previous time. The player will have to locate the controls they need and determine what they do through trial and error, while also keeping track of the position of the monsters and their robot outside the tower. The controls to fire the robot’s laser might be on the opposite side of the tower from where the robot currently is, so the player will be shifting their gaze back and forth from activating controls to seeing what effects they have. Only through careful multitasking and memorization can the player save the city from certain destruction.
