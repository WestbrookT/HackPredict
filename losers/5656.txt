Menagerie will be a virtual art experience - a collection of installations, eye candy, and interactive experiments. I want to explore some of the possibilities that virtual reality provides as an artistic medium. VR overflows with fresh avenues to explore: kinetic pieces, works that react to the viewer, immersive environments, interactive creative toys. 
The viewer will be presented with a variety of separate environments with freedom to move among them and explore at their own pace. Some will be passive experiences and others will encourage interaction and experimentation. 
I want to push the limits of the Gear VR hardware with impressive visuals, spectacular particles, and realistic physics simulations. There's a lot of horsepower to be harnessed on the Note 4 and I want to put it to good use. 
Challenges will include finding a balance between the flashy visuals and hardware performance so that the app can maintain a smooth 60 frames per second. I also want to provide the viewer with intuitive controls that make it easy to explore and control the pieces. Finding an over-arching theme to tie it all together would also be nice, though nothing has come to mind yet.
