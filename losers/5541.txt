Story:
Expedition Europa is an interactive adventure that lets you explore Jupiter`s moon, Europa via a submersible, possibly discovering alien life forms under the frozen surface.
Interaction:
Gaze interaction will be used to maximize potential players, as some gear vr owners do not have a controller, i feel it is important to capitalise on a hands free experience.
This can be done with a choose your own adventure style story, that lets the user define choices at various points in the game.
Technical challenges:
To exploit the Gear VR`s capabilities, I will be focusing on rich textures instead of high polycounts using procedural imaging and baking instead of realtime lighting.
