Your journey starts as a youngster in New York city at the turn of the 20th century.  What better place for a hungry, growing, storm drain dwelling monster to grow up.  The people are as plentiful as they are delicious, though they can be tricky to catch.  You'll need all the people you can eat to completing your life cycle and lay some eggs for the next generation.
As they monster grows, its metabolism does as well.  A big monster needs big food, and it's up to the player to lure in meals using whatever can be found.
I expect the biggest challenge will be to create an immersive environment with the limited computing power on mobile.  I have no idea what to expect.  How many characters do I need to on screen at once to bring life to the world?  What kind of AI is possible?  How much variety in the world and in gameplay are necessary for a fun experience?  Is it worth the cost in performance to have clothes lines run across the buildings?
