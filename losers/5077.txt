Long time ago ...when Sys Admin had black hairs ....
Nyhow ..
Ultron --> prediction model to analyze and predict the reason behind the system fault. this is a rule based mechanism.
feeds on Ceilometer Events for now (can be extended to notificartions, logs, AMQP's), time based matching of events for prediction.
Observer --> on the Go Light weight (Mobile app + web interface) for Monitoring stats and events, along with any Critical information, presented in intuitive and simple format
Together like all super heros they come together to save Sys Admin from the Horror of manual intervention. 
Next Year they are being launched by DC comics too.. I have heard Arya Starks Ultrons fan.!!
