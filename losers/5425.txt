Borealis is a first-person casual/adventure Virtual Reality game drawing on tribal themes of spirituality and combat. When a mysterious meteor breaks the atmosphere, both land and living are caught in the aftermath. The natural world is withering and a vicious evil runs rampant. Players take the role of Vohlkine, the Guardian from the Wargar tribe. Using powers of the light and the sharpness of a blade, players are tasked with slaying the corrupted. 
The player's objective is to destroy the alien stone responsible for the outbreak. While creatures flood in from the dark corners of the forest, you will need to survive and ward off enemies until the stone is destroyed. Once the stone is destroyed, the deep crimson colored skies will transition to beautiful blue and purple tones. Gameplay incorporates a blend of arcade and hack-and-slash styles.
The game can be played with the Gear touchpad:
