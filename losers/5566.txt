You're the head of food prep at the hottest burger joint in VR. You get hundreds of custom orders a day and you've got to make sure that customers get exactly the kind of burger they ask for. You're stationary in your kitchen but you've constantly got to be looking around to make sure all the right ingredients are going into your burger. The kitchen is your setting and you've got all your ingredients lined up in your 180 field of view. You start when the bun drops onto the counter from the bun maker. From here you've got to look at the order screen. As time progresses the orders will start to pile up and they'll get increasingly more difficult. If too many orders pile up, your customers will get frustrated and you will lose the game.
