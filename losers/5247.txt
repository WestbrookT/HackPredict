Has he got the skills to keep this party poppin?!? 
Keep the crowd happy or it gets SHUT DOWN. 
That's it. 
DONE.
By far the biggest hurdle we've faced so far is developing a reliable process to synchronize music with the players' experience. 
DJ Choppa is a DJ sim where you interact with the crowd!
Do they love you or do they hate you?!?
Check the love/hate meter to see how you are performing. Keep the crowd
loving you by matching beats on time. Miss enough beats and it's game over.
Controller needed (left joystick to match beats, x button to pause)
Headphones recommended
Things we wanted to accomplish but didn't get to...
*Pooling the crowd animations to play specific animations at certain times.
*Tightening up the position of the notifications on screen.
*Matching the music and notifications with better timing.
*Implement soundboard mode
Q. What would we do different next time:?
A. Seek out testers earlier in our process.
