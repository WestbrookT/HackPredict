Educational game for Virtual Reality about cell microworld in early development stage. This Jam is a great oppurtunity for our team (5 guys) to hack the development roadmap and meet real feedback from players and experienced judges.
The player will experience an exciting journey into patients's cell to observe a fascinating microworld of human body and fight in never-ending war against destructive viruses.
The future is nigh. The humanity is standing upon the brink of a new era where modern healthcare makes tremendous scientific advancements. With the help of nanotechnologies a surgical prototype bathyscaphe allows its operator to shrink to a microlevel and travel inside the patient's body.
