“City of the Dead” is a first person horror shooter putting the player in the center of a city square with hordes of zombies coming for him. How long can you survive? 
Using 3D sounds, the player hears the approaching foes before he can see them. Turning towards the sounds they will come into the lights of the street. A dense, dark atmosphere created with shadows & light as well as sounds & music will give the player goosebumps while enjoying a unique horror VR experience. 
Upgrading your weapons and honing your skills with the gun, rifle and knife are essential for a competitive score. Use the few and short breaks to update your stats, reload your weapons and improve your health. Timing and aim is everything in a city infested by the walking dead.
