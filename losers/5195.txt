The application would make users interact with a dog( maybe beagle) like they are naturally interacting with one.
The dog would respond to the interactions of the user.The response would be in the form of barks , tail movement, running to fetch things etc.The user can get attention the dog by making noises like whistling and even playing with their hands gestures to do stuff like throw a ball.The dog will behave  like a normal dog and would have to fed and do stuff with occasionally  to survive.
The use: 
1)Some people are scared of dogs ,hopefully this app will tell them how good dogs can be.
2)Many families cant keep dogs because the children in the house have allergies to dust and hair;through this app they can virtually enjoy a pet.
