An easy to use API that allows your app to do all sorts of awesome things with files. Server optional. You just send us a file and we generate an image preview of every page, layer, OCR text, EXIF metadata and much more. We can work with Word, PowerPoint, Photoshop, Illustrator, RAW, PDF, audio and video files. We have a very long and growing list of supported file types. Each file type is treated specially to maximize the amount of data that we extract.
