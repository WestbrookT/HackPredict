Using open data to create an Alexa skill that I would use everyday!
The skill tells the user the menu to a wished canteen in Munich. Currently there are roughly 5-10 supported student canteens. The skill can not only tell you todays menu, but also for the future.
Currently it's only available in German, because the userbase is primarly German. English will follow soon, however.
It's using node.js and the corresponding alexa SDK. The data is coming from the public API of openmensa.org
I find it hard to determine good and well designed utterances. But by asking some friends and others I was able to finetune the utterances so the skill now understands natural questions and commands.
