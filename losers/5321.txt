Working on a project with only two people total while brainstorming ideas, creating an app, and simultaneously being on a time limit has been quite a challenge. Learning new skills using Android Studio has also been a challenge. It takes time to learn a skill and there are so many things that we want to add in our application. Android Studio was also acting up and creating some technical difficulties for us. We had to start all over from the beginning several time.  But, we haven't let any of these challenges stop us. We will continue pushing through until the end.
We are very proud of all that we have accomplished with this project. Even though we have far fewer teammates than most of the other groups, we have managed to use our time wisely. We have learned how to create aspects of activities within Android Studio that we hadn't known before. We are very proud of how far we have come.
