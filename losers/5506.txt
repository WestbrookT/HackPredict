VR Music visualizer which allows users to load tracks from their music library and experience them with various visualizations, including abstract style visualizations, "DJ mode" and "Concert Mode".
Currently looking for more artists to help collaborate / contribute artwork and music.
Current status as of Milestone 3 - Pretty happy with the engine, just need some time to add and tweak new effects for different genres of music.  Got quite a few other ideas in mind as well, including some features to make things a little more interactive.
