Experience with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and wanting to build something cool.
Takes a youtube video, parse it into frames and run those images through a Convolutional Neural Network to decypher video content
Bootleged ways int ograbbing frames from youtube videos - then threw CNNs at it.
I had to use sudo to install anything with pip because I was lazy and didn't want to fix $PYTHONPATH's.  It was also a pain getting info from youtube without the help of their APIs
Build something that actually works and does something cool
Big Data things are much harder and much more time consuming that one may think.
Build up the database and perform some machine learning algorithms on the data.
