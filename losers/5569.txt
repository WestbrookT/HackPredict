OpMazes lets you immersively navigate through mazes that are procedurally generated from 2D optical art illusions - in an oldskool style. Itâ€™s innovative in its combination of AR with VR - and also tying back to classic game graphics.  
The user can browse through a book of op-art and see these mazes raise-up-from-the-page from an aerial view - and also option to "enter" each maze in a first person perspective in the guise of a classic game dungeon.

Milestone 3: Please excuse the horrible quality of currently buggy gameplay video. It's a few builds behind.
