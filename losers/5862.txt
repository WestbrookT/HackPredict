I'm annoyed by emails that are useless. Especially when I'm expecting good or bad news, it's always distracting to have emails that I don't need to see get in the way of the ones that are actually important. And it's a total pain to go through and sort them out... so I decided to make a program to do it for me, and anyone else who wants their inboxes to be a little more relevant to their lives.
In the next version, it will be able to scan your emails and use your past history to figure out which emails you'll find interesting, and which you won't. Currently most of the code is implemented, but because of a last minute technical glitch, for the hackathon I decided to build a UI and concept demo into the current version. 
I built it myself in a period of 21 consecutive hours. I had already thought a bit through the idea and which components were necessary. When I arrived at the hackathon I diagrammed the concept on paper and then coded.
One challenge was that most of the API's I used were previously unknown or highly unfamiliar to me. Perhaps the most unique challenge I ran into here was using python-shell to allow my node.js server to run a python script for the machine learning. There were interesting challenges here revolving around combining an inherently asynchronous system with the serial processing power required for machine learning. 
I'm proud that I was able to build an entire application by myself, from the front end to the back end, in under 24 hours. That was something I always aspired to as a developer, and I'm happy to have gotten closer to the goal.
One of the biggest areas of knowledge I gained in was knowledge of servers and hosting. This was an area I had never even touched before, so it was very informative! Other than that, I gained invaluable experience with all of the API's involved in this app.
I'm going to polish out the bugs and get a working version up as soon as possible.
