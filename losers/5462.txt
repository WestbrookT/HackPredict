I’m not sure how long this pitch should be but, I will keep it short and simple. The pitch that I am submitting is an app / experiences. An app that will allow the user to create an avatar that can then be imported into any virtual reality world that supports the system. This system will allow user / player the ability to jump right into the virtual reality environment without the hassle of making any avatar if the environment require one.  This system will also help developer focus on making better game content by freeing them from main character creation. In this system the user would get articles of clothing and accessories in the place of achievements or trophies. So for an example you just got “You Made Your Point” an achievement in Portal 2, in my system you would get a watch. Or, let’s say you are going to a virtual concert you would get a necklaces as your ticket. The system will allow developer the power to express themselves much farther than just the world that they have develop.
