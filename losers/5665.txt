Pre-Milestone Note:  4/26
This first week has been great as we've been integrating HUDs and new levels as we settle on the final style and look of the game.  It plays great on PC, so we will spend this second week "trimming it down" and porting it for use on the Gear VR while we fine tune the enemy AI.
Pre-Milestone Note:  5/04
The second week has been a real challenge while working to integrate AI and new HUD elements, along with getting the Oculus working with the new global signature settings for testers.  It's coming down to the wire, and we've already had to start over from scratch once, but doing something twice means doing it better the second time around, and we have no plans to stop until the final day of competition.  Thanks to everyone who believes in us and has followed us along the way!
