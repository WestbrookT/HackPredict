Snow Angel is a game that strives to immerse players in a virtual reality experience. The game looks to imitate a real life experience by placing them in a realistic situation they can become attached to.
    Snow Angel is a game in which players are put into the shoes of a young child desperately trying to save his youthful love. The setting happens to be a snowball fight in which he must defend his crush from the bullies that seek to harm her. Players must engage in the heated battle in order to overcome the situation and prove their worth to the girl.
    Players in Snow Angel must fend off the bullies by throwing snow balls at them by way of careful aim. Players need to aim their throws by simply looking in the direction of the bully they wish to hit with their snowball. Players must also replenish their ammo of snowballs by focusing their attention to their stockpile placed to their side. There is danger at all times though for the bullies also have their own snowball projectiles that are being thrown at you. Players need to use the snow mound positioned in front of them to duck at crucial times to avoid being hit. Players must balance offense and defense by positioning their head above and below their snow mound in order to survive.
