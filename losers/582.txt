Initially, we ran into several issues in the back end. The local IIS authentication to the SQL server proved too challenging to master in this short period of time, so databases did not end up working out for us.
We are proud that we were able to create a working, fun end product. This is the first time that any of us had participated in a Hackathon, and it was great to see what we could collectively accomplish in 36 hours. We are proud that we were able to utilize Signal R/web sockets for client communication. Being able to get all of this functional in a short period of time was frustrating, but very worthwhile.
We learned a lot about how to use web sockets in a practical way. Some of us were also introduced to bootstrap and making the front end of a website practical and visually appealing. Overall, we each learned a different skill that helped us to work together to come up with a successful end product.
Ideally, we would like to improve some of the features of this web application. If we were to scale the project to reach a greater audience, some of the features would need to be made more efficient as well.
