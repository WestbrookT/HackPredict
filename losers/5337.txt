Elements is an immersive reimagining of the periodic table. We’ve transformed the traditional 2D periodic table into a cinematic space where elements move dynamically in the scene and respond to the user’s gaze, taps, and swipes. To invite curiosity and exploration, we’ve created a compelling visual for each individual element’s atom, simulating how it would look like at a microscopic level if time were slowed down.
When Elements starts, a flock of tiles fly into view and assemble into a curvilinear space, enveloping the user in the form of the traditional periodic table. 
When the touchpad is tapped while hovering over an element group, the selected group comes forward as the rest of the table recedes. Information pops out kinetically to give the user more information about the group. 
When an element within this group is selected with another tap of the touchpad, all other tiles are cast away, and the quantum model of the element’s atom emerges along with a detailed UI view of the element itself. Schrodinger’s wave equations are brought to life, and the complex organization of the atom is joyfully discovered.
