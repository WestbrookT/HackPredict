Most of the enterprises are moving to cloud. The biggest issue while moving to cloud is migrating existing datacenter to cloud.
Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform.
The regular way to onboard a datacenter to CloudStack is very tedious.
We aimed to solve this problem by on-boarding an existing datacenter to Apache CloudStack running cloud with no downtime.
