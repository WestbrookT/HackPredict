The aim of the project is to create an augmented reality game environment using the Gear VR. The player can look around to move their in game avatar.
The game itself will place the player in a VR environment where they will be able to interact using their virtual avatar to solve puzzles. The player will be able to use their avatar in various ways to effect parts of the environment. The interaction the player will have will by physics based and range from such things as controlling the flow of a liquid to moving blocks around in the world.
The puzzles are fairly simplistic in nature to start with allowing the player to become accustomed with the virtual interactions. Then the complexity of the puzzles and the variation of the virtual interactions is gradually stepped up, increasing the level of difficulty as well as the level of immersion in the virtual world.
