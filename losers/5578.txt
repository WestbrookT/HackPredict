The app or experience I want to create is to give users the ability to use VR to enjoy their favorite sites like 9gag, Tumblr, Reddit, blogs, Facebook Feeds, and all other applicable sites with RSS feeds. The site works best with images (including gif and videos if I am able to implement them as well). Imagine sitting on a rotating office chair, pop in your gear VR and view each page of 9gag site in front of you, to your left, right and behind you. You can check out the next page by looking right or look at a previous article by looking left, either that or using the touch pad. You can upvote an article by nodding your head 3 times or downvote a post by turning your head left and right 3 times. More fun features can be added too!
Milestone 2 Update:
The Screenshots show a sample of a children's story book being presented in VR. Each page will be saved online and can be browsed by looking left or right for previous and next pages respectively and these can be cycled using gestures or Gear VR's interface buttons.
