This first person puzzle game let's you be nanotechnology engineer by shrinking you down to a microscopic scale so that you can build/repair micro-machines.
First person puzzle game where the player completes challenges by rolling modular nanotechnology components around a level.  The player is in a series of rooms which they may freely navigate. The room has at least one “Shape” the player can interact with, and one key location (usually a button) that the block must be moved to. The blocks are locked to a grid and as the game progresses the puzzles become more challenging and new mechanics are introduced.
Some of the first mechanics added to the game will be different shaped blocks; the shapes may add difficulty based on the environment.  For example a long block four cubes tall might not be able to pass through a doorway. Other shapes will have challenges associated with their geometry itself, an example would be the “T” shape; It can't be rolled from all positions in all directions because it would't be able to complete a rotation with only one axis to rotate on.
At first the rooms will be fairly simple allowing the player to get a feel for how to manipulate the puzzle environment and how some of the basic shaped pieces may move. As the game progresses mechanics such as patrolling blocks, and behavioural blocks are introduced. Patrolling cubes move along a predetermined path by themselves. Behavioural blocks have behaviours; for example a shy block might move away from the player if the player stares directly at it, or an aggressive cube might begin to chase a player if the player stares at it or walks too close to it.
