      The player runs around freely in an open world, encountering story elements as you go along and gaining power and experience during your progression.  Along the way, you will meet powerful allies who will fight alongside you as you endeavor to destroy the virus piece by piece.  Each character has an array of interchangeable abilities that allow the player to customize how their characters will interact with the challenges they will face.  In order to destroy various pieces of the virus and repair the damage it has done to the network, you must hack into the various data streams that comprise the virtual world and play turn based strategy games in order to eliminate pieces of data corrupted by the virus.  These corrupted pieces of data will not be removed without a fight.  
      We hope that this game will open the door to further strategy game development in the VR marketplace. We feel that this genre is currently under-explored by the VR community and that there is serious room for growth. Using this game as a demonstration, our goal is to expand upon its themes and ideas in order to create more games for the VR community and marketplace.
The open world is being built up. Characters are being made and animated. The combat system is pretty well squared away. We are working through builds and adding in art assets as they become complete.
