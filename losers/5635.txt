My idea for this project is to illustrate the experience of Visual Plasticity. Visual Plasticity was the corner stone of the Modernist Art movement. Throughout history painters have attempted to represent three-dimensional volume and space on a two-dimensional surface (picture plane). The implied movement between these two dimensions is visual plasticity.
Painters use planes of color in a plastic composition to visually activate the picture plane. The picture plane answers every plastic animation automatically.  A push into space is answered by a pull out. The space created is always changing. It has been suggested that the picture plane reacts like a balloon when one part is pushed in another part comes forward. Once activated the space has an automatic plastic response that creates the experience of multi dimensional space.  In the dynamics of this spatial experience lies the expressive value of a painting, the feeling lies in the implied three-dimensional form.
My idea is to create a program, which would show a painting, first in its two-dimensional natural state, and then with the use of the software show how through observing the parts of the paintings space changes. 
About ten years ago with the help of some students at Miami University in Ohio, I attempted to use a simple Java script to illustrate this phenomenon. I used the painting Sanctum Sanctorum by the modernist painter Hans Hofmann. And although it illustrates the idea by making planes larger as they come forward and smaller as they go back it didn’t relay the experience of true three- dimensional volume. This is where I feel the Oculus VR can help.
I am currently working with Champlain College in their Emergent Media Center to have the java script program converted into Unity and I’m waiting to see the results.
I always thought of this project as a learning tool to teach people how to see a painting. Now with the use of VR it should present an amazing plastic experience.
