We wanted to get out and about more, so we made something to motivate people to do so. Oftentimes, people want to exercise while getting some fresh air. However, it may be difficult to decide where to start. The web app makes this experience much easier for users who hope to exercise on a route with specified inputs. Furthermore, Wanderloo ensures that people can exercise outside year long by adding a feature that provides paths which are accessible even in the Winter.
This user-friendly web app allows for users to customize their very own exercise route. This can be done in a variety of ways such as the length of the route, surface type of the route, etc. Wanderloo takes the user's preferences and filters out all the walkable paths in the region of Kitchener-Waterloo that do not align with the user's wishes. Using the user's location, it then creates and displays a customized route that is closest user. 
Using City of Waterloo Trails from the city's open data, we extracted walkable trails and their properties such as surface and length. We collected user input using JavaScript on a website built with HTML and CSS, and saved these files to a local file on the computer. Using Python, we obtained the city's data and optimized routes by creating our own .kml file which is accessed using the Google Maps JavaScript API and placed as an overlay on a map.
