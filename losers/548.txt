Back in 2007, I was a young design engineer at Caterpillar, working on CAD models of engine parts. It was neat and all, but I hated having to use my mouse + some fancy keyboard work to spin / move / scale models. It was both  hands on the table all the time. 
Careful, Chief. Dig up the past, all you get is dirty.
And with CAD Viewer, I think I'm halfway (ok, 10%) there.
Color Tracking CAD Viewer is a JavaScript web app that lets you spin and rotate 3D STL models using color tracking. Using a magenta token—like my purple Sharpie— I can lean back in my chair and spin models by waving my hand around in front of my webcam. 
The pen really is mightier
Dat GUI tho!
Blerg. Munging all this JS into one useable app was a bit of a pain. I ran into some trouble getting the app to run smoothly, which is probably because I basically copy & pasted two tutorials together. 
Also, I was planning on adding a "upload STL model" button, but I ran out of time.
And of course, there's still tons of unused / outdated code left in the comments + a heap of extra JS from the examples folder that I haven't cleared out yet.
Well, it sorta works. So you know, achievement unlocked. ✓
Yep.
Don't code after 11pm without taking a nap first. It won't go well. Also, commit early and commit often.
