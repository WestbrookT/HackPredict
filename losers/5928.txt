Bitlyopath is an app which plays "the music of the moment". Based on Bitly's trends API and combined with taxonomical enrichment from the Sociocast API and a streaming music API, we were able to select songs to play that reflected whatever the trending topics currently were. At the time of the event, we were playing Kanye West songs that were chosen because of the birth of his child with Kim Kardashian.
