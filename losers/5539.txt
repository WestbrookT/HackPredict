The Pig Simulator is intented to give the player the unique opportunity to see the world through the eyes of a pig. The player plays the Pig in the First Person Perspective as it is processed in a Meat Production Facility.   
To get more precise the simulation takes place in the last moment of a livestock pig, as it is transported to the slaughter house. And further “processed” into the meat product, as we all know it from the supermarket and our refrigerator. 
Goal here is to show the real process as it is used here in Germany (2014/15) or greater civilized Europe. It aims to depict the state of the art of industrial killing of animals, nothing more nothing less. No sides are taken - a documentary style. Of course with a few modifiactions due to game play. 
Technically the game is aimed at usage with the Oculus VR and Gear VR HMD, consequently it is all about immersing into the pigs view of the process. But can also be played from in a usual FPS mode on monitor.
Obviously the greatest impact will happen with the OVR version, since the experience is about immerision and the empathy it influences in the player. 
So the main dev focus is on the virtual experience.
OPTIONAL: as the pig is stunned the view shifts to the human. The player is now the worker in the slaughterhouse and has to preform the action of killing the pig and further processing of the carcass, the player has the OPTION to decide whether to do perform it or not. Of course this would mean a enormous raise in complexity of the simulation. So it has to be considered if this is possible in the time budget.
