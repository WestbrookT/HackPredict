It will be the experience of a dog, who has to balance between getting his way as opposed to the owner's in subtle ways and less subtle ways, and giving just enough cute behaviour to escape any kind of retribution. It's based on my dog, pictured.
It will involve actions such as chasing ball, catching it, then losing it in obscure places, then pretending not to understand why the owner doesn't throw another ball, etc, all light hearted, and made if for nothing else, for benefit of my nieces :-)
