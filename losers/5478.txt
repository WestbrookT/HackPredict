Any holy men or women were not just disrespected, but made to exile into the remotest of the himalayan mountains. They prayed still, believed still, that vishnu, the creator had his intentions in making them who they are and bhrama would preserve them, in any conditions, but fates had something else written for them, it was the DESTROYER who had his eyes on them.
