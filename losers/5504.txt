We want to reproduce experience of ski jumping. It's really hard to do because this experience depends on how accurately physics of ski jumper flight is simulated. Also we want to add global leaderboard to add competitiveness to the game. At the moment we have nearly solved all the problems with physics, graphics and data storage. Now we are in search of a way how to identify player in the game. If you have some ideas about frameworks that can be used in Unity3d to identify the player and support VR (or this support can be added in few hours) pls comment with ideas.
