The inspiration for this project was to increase the accuracy and information that is at the hands of users using public transportation. Through collaboration with the user, we can help improve the process for everyone.
On the surface, the application introduces very little from the normal experience the user may be used to. A user can indicate where they want to go and receive instructions on how to get to their destination. As the user progresses through their trip, the application will prompt the user with updates and ask for user feedback on their trip. Under the hood, the application will update arrival times and departure times for the various bus stops based on the user feedback and feed this out to the originating user and other users. This results in greater accuracy for users waiting on buses on when exactly their bus will arrive.
The application is built on Ionic 2. The backend is built on Ruby on Rails. It utilizes Google's directions and transit information as well as using a data feed pulled from GTFS records. This application could work with any city that GTFS information is available for.
Next steps for the application would be expanding the functionalities of the app to make it more friendly for the user beyond the core functionality presented here. Possibly allowing for users to have accounts, save common routes, etc.
On the server side, the arrival and departure time estimator needs further development and tuning to be more accurate and present better data to users. The server would also need to be further developed to match any development done in the application.
