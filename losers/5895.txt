In the current hustle and bustle of today's world, our needs change...fast. Fortunately, however, these changes are routine. You go to the office...you come back from the office. You go to school...you come back from school. You have a 4:00 meeting...your 4:00 meeting ends. However, preparing for many of these things is very time consuming. For example, you might want to have your home page in Safari be your work email at work, but then your personal email at home. And then when you get home you might want to always start playing music, but first you have to fire up Spotify, find the song, and waste a bunch of time. They say the center of your digital life is your smartphone, but still so much are we dependent on our computers to do the most mundane, yet useful tasks. To solve this we created taskibe.
Taskibe is an automation service that bridges the gap between your phone and your computer. All you need to do is create a task on your iPhone (using our app) then the magic of our technology runs the task at the appropriate time on your computer. Things range from playing songs, deleting files in Finder, navigating the web, and more. The best part is that all of the code that allows for this magic is server side. Even though you have to run a mac client that to operate the commands, the server pushes down the code needed to run that command so you NEVER need to update the Mac or the iPhone client––everything is auto-generated on the fly based off the available commands in the server.
For once, your phone and your computer are one and the practice is just beginning.
