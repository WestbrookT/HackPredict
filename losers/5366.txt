We are building the metaverse for language learners. Users can do quests, socialize with other users, and get tutored by native speakers from around the world. We believe that VR is much more personal and social than Skype, and more contextual and convenient than in-person tutoring. In our trials thus far, students have also indicated they are completely focused, which makes VR a powerful medium for learning.
For this contest, we are designing quests that simulate every day life in a foreign country. For instance, the user may need to go find milk at a grocery store, or ask for directions. We are incorporating speech recognition and text to speech to make the experience as immersive as the real world.
