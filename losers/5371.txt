A Hybrid clock like those in Tron movie.It is entirely designed in pure python.
I created this clock for purely Educational purpose. Anybody can download code to play around.
With patience and good python knowledge, we can simulate real world things like Analog clock but in a 21'st century style.That is power of computing which is funnier with python.
The dial consists of three pins.
Yellow color : second pin
Grey color : Minute pin
Blue color : Hour pin
