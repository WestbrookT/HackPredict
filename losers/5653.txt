I want to be a SAMURAI. But It is difficult because haven’t skill.
We can become easily SAMURAI with VR.
Operation if simple, We would get more excited on game.
A lot of enemies would attack you when you start the game.
The match is a moment. Protect against enemy attacks, then Attack!
You continue the game, and your senses will sharp.
Will you become a SAMURAI…?
[Operation Plan]
The game use a sword. We have 2 ideas.
1 : use wii remote controller.
    For example, you react to enemy attacks right or left.
    If you success you can attack and win.
2 : not use wii remote controller.
    use only headtracking.
In any case we want challenge simple operation and excitement.
