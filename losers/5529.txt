‘Meta’ was created and performed by Steph Hutchison as a danced response to working with John McCormick and his AI Agent throughout the rehearsal and performance of ‘Emergence’.
The VR representation of Meta creates a further riff off of the these 2 works and brings a new perspective to contemporary dance by breaking down the qualities of human motion and reconstituting them in an abstract expression of movement.
