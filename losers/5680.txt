Player starts in a procedurally generated maze with a number of enemies with the aim to grab the player and take them back to the start. The player must navigate through the maze without being touched by any enemies, solving puzzles along the way using enemies and interactive objects within the game. The unique selling point of this game is this: to impede the enemies movements towards the player, you must look at the enemy, causing them to stop, move differently or move completely. This method of player "attack" will link into the puzzles throughout the game and give the player a new way to play games, coupled with an immersive horror experience.
The game will take place within first person with the standard VR character controls. Stay alive by keeping eyes on the enemies while solving increasingly difficult problems.
