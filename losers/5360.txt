This game is a combination RPG and action game that allows players to take on the role of a character trapped inside a world meant to represent the inside of their device. 
The player will complete mini-games that make up the individual levels, which contribute to the goal of escaping from the virtual world. 
Players will run around collecting items, drive through checkpoint races, fly through hoops, and various other tasks.
The game will use the third person viewpoint to allow the player to control a selected avatar, with both online and offline modes. Chat will use voice recognition to create chat bubbles visible to all characters.
The player will be able to move around using a joystick or look using the head tracking of their VR headset. Gameplay will require a controller for movement.
