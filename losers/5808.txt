Jersey Java Annotation Extension for creating REST/POST Methods
I was developing an application that needed to have a lot of services which had
to be accessed with both GET and POST Operations, but unfortunately Jersey doesn't 
support it. 
A workaround is creating not one but 3 methods for every Service 
Operation I wanted, using one as a Business container and the other two just for
declaring jersey's operation methods like this:
This was very troublesome so I decided to create my own annotation that would 
generate this for me.
