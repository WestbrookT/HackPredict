I wanted to create a simple way for desktop users to book an uber without the need to pull out their mobile device. By developeing as a chrome extension it allows deeper integration into the users browser than a regular website. The following features are made possible from this deeper integration:
All aspects of the apps stack are written in javascript. There is a very simple nodejs server that handles the token exchanging when a user first authenticates with the app which is passed to the chrome extension. After that point all of the requests come directly from within the extension and do not use a server side component apart from when token refreshing is needed. The front end of the extension is written with angular js with a bootstrap template, it integrates with the native chrome apis via several wrappers I wrote to allow for easier development in the browser before packaging as an extension.
In order to keeo the experience similar to the mobile app geolocation is used for setting the users start position and the map is dragged to refine the start position. Google places API is used for entering the destination or refining the pick up point. Google directions API is used to render a predicted route that the driver will take.
