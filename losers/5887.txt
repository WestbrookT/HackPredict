For years my friend Mateo and I have talked about corporate whistle blowing, and how business needs to be more transparent in general.  We saw potential with apps like Secret and Whisper to be used in the corporate arena. With Secret shutting down this week, we see a void in the market, and wanted to jump on the opportunity.
Whistle is an app for iOS and Android, the functional prototype built in the past 24 hours.  It lets you login or register and then start creating "whistles."  A whistle can then be shared publicly anonymously, or kept in your personal whistle list to be shared later.  Whistles can also be shared to just certain contacts that the user selects, although those users will never see the "source."  For whistles that a user can see, then can upvote (agreeing with the Whistle) or downvote.  Based on the upvotes, downvotes, and the level of connection (via LinkedIn, not integrated yet), each Whistle gets substantiated as truth or rumor by the community.
