Anomaly is a zero-gravity walking simulator. Set in the wreckage of a scientific colony around a mysterious pulsing light, the game aims to induce a sense of vastness and a sense of loneliness. The player slowly picks up vignettes of narrative and gathers mysterious mechanical components to put together a story of what has happened here and to figure out what to do with themself.
Currently we have the game working with both a regular 2D display and with the Oculus. One of the unique experiences Anomaly provides is a sense of vertigo and falling through space, even as the player remains seated and essentially stationary. We have found the a realistic simulation of movement and acceleration increases the player's immersion and reduces or even eliminates motion sickness.
Our main challenge going forward is generating content of sufficient content and quality to be able to assemble an engaging narrative experience.
