Broadcat puts the news of the world back in context. Using sentiment analysis on both headlines and GIFs, Broadcat makes magic by creating perfect GIF-headline pairings. In other words, Broadcat restores balance in an otherwise chaotic world.
News headlines are not the most interesting thing for today's youth -- and often they're even misleading. Broadcat solves these problems by engaging youth by speaking their language: GIF. It's a new way of reading the news, a new way of inspiring today's youth to take an interest in the world around them, and it's a great way to start new adventure. 
Broadcat is an experiment in seeing how far sentiment analysis can / should go. While some of the pairings may seem somewhat arbitrary at first, it doesn't take long to spot some shared sentiment. At the very least, you should be able to spot the universal sentiment: a love of cats (and their GIFs).
