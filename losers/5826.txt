Say a cat has pushed the mouse off your desk. You simply press a single key to and a grid of options appear simply select a point and your mouse will click it. This can easily be used for power-users to enhance their productivity
We used threads to implement a invisible window, and use python libraries to handle key events.
We originally wanted to try to do the same thing that Vimium did with only display letters for things to click but we simply didn't have the means to implement that.
Very powerful simple and markable product.
I personally have learned a little python from this project.
We hope to eventually implement this to closely match Vimium
