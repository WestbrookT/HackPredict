We were playing around with Alchemy, and we thought that it would cool to measure engagement of customers through through facial recognition in the retail space. We thought it would satisfy a real world need. 
Uses Alchemy to count the number of customers who come into your store, and provides you with demographic information. 
Tracking moving faces and not counting them multiples times. Really identifying a problem, and ways of adding value while solving the problem for the end consumer. Making sure that we had identified a use case scenario before we began creating tools to solve it. 
Coming together as a team. Integrating our different skills and perspectives. Not giving up when we hit a dead-end. Being optimistic throughout. We are proud of the fact that we developed a proprietary alogristhim that will allow us to track faces, and determines when a new person arrives on the scene. 
How to use IBM Watson technologies, how to use the Alchemy API. How to work together as a team. 
Improve the algorithm to identify further demographic info, and potentially analyze facial expression. We would also like to explore its use in retail.
