Noctica is primarily a platform for people to explore artistic expression in a Virtual Reality space.  Instead of trying to create the whole "multiverse", as many are want to do, Noctica aims at a smaller niche - storytelling.  The platform contains many modular pieces, from trees and plants to animals and avatars - and props across the board.  
Most people who try out virtual reality want nothing more then to create something in that world.  The barrier of entry is higher then probably any other medium to date, so the primary goal with this project is to allow for people to easily create virtual spaces from within virtual reality itself.   
The full scope of this projects ambition is not yet realized.  Many of these modular elements have been explored and flushed out however the multi user aspect and user content based system are not yet implemented.
This version is a strong proof of concept with 4 different worlds built out to demonstrate the potentials with one of them streaming in while running the app.  Planned development will be in the direction of most everything be generated on the fly in the background with as little content baked into scenes.  This will be a critical step towards allowing users to generate their own worlds in a lightweight and shareable manner.  The aesthetic uses no textures to allow the video ram to be allocated towards artwork.  Streaming in audio assets as well will further lighten whole project and allow for more user content creation.
