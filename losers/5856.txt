The problem we want to solve is enabling people to find financial balance. Our hypothesis is that by automating the bugeting process and encouraging users to focus on the things in their lives, we can help users save 10% more of their income on a monthly basis, while increasing their financial well-being.
Using figma, framer, xcode, APIs
Implimenting the Plaid API and figuring out our next steps. We could have definitely asked for more help.
Leaving with a foundation to test and iterate on the core value of Livn, so we can solve the problem we are after. 
Hack@Brown was an awesome experience that helped us learn and play around with new technologies, but the biggest lesson we are leaving with is knowledge of what we didn't know before. 
Learn some things, try some things, break some things, and ask for help along the way until we create value.
