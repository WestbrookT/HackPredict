Watching people watch videos is fun. The Reactory makes it easy, too!
Enter a YouTube or Vimeo or Instagram (or any video provider supported by Embedly), a start time and play time, and The Reactory will let you capture people's reaction to the video clip.
After you record your reaction, you can share the reaction video with your friends!
