When the date and the price is fixed, but not the destination. Snap helps people pick where to go at the very last minute.
At 11am on Tuesday, tune into Snap for the best offers for what you can get up to next weekend.
Anybody can browse through hundreds of tabs; Snap is an opinionated way of browsing just five "good" options only for "next weekend". User preferences, home airport, budget and other stored preferences are factored into a simple "snap choice". 
This overturns the normal flight search process. Instead of picking
... Snap will just assume dates and home airport and show a list of great value destinations, found by the Skyscanner "everywhere" search. We combine hotel and other deals around this.
To sweeten the display of results, we show the value of your home neighborhood on AirBnB (powered by Zilyo API) as a cost-saving for a weekend getaway: A €500 trip might only cost €300! 
When we generate these 5 options, they can be shared with a travel companion as a shared challenge. Voted separately, the results are shared afterwards and booking can then take place for your common choice. Booking would be eventually via Skyscanner and Hotelbeds. 
We wanted to try a new framework this weekend, which just didn't work out for us!
