Too long have we missed an event simply because we were unaware of either the time or location. Oh what there was a game last night? It seems that we just never know what is happening on campus. With What the Happening, we'll finally be on top of all that is happening on campus.
What the Happening is a web app integrated with google maps that allow users to both input events (time, description, map location) into our database and see all the events other users' have inputted in a simple to use interface. Events are displayed in chronological order on the right sidebar with location markers showing the user-inputted location 
What the Happening was built on angular.js and bootstrap for the front end, sqlite3 for the database and Node.js and Express.js to implement the server. Furthermore, we used the google maps API to implement the map functionalities. 
Challenges we ran into were making sure certain HTML elements do not overlap as well as making sure the user inputted data was stored correctly in the back end. Another challenge was organizing the code into a readable and understandable format as 5 people working on the same files is hard to keep up with.
For a first time hackathon, we are proud of being able to get a simple front end and workable backend up and running for the intended purpose of our idea. Over the course of half a day, we were able to execute on an idea we had.
Hackathons are fun and tiring and a great way to learn new things such as APIs, nuances of a language, and how to combine all the different files, languages, and APIs to a workable product. 
For the future of What the Happening we are looking at integration with facebook events as well as google calendar such that the events will not all be user inputted. As well we are looking at applying filters to events to enhance the user experience.
