Profanity Pig is your sidekick in ending bad swearing habits. 
We want to help people monitor their bad language, one swear at a time. Profanity Pig squeals back against your profanity and makes sure any punishments are ultimately for a good cause - for you and your chosen charity. 
Use the built-in coin slot for self-imposed penalties or link Profanity Pig to a credit card or PayPal and automatically fine yourself for every naughty word you say. Payments will be totalled weekly and sent to your chosen charity. 
Customise your curses to match your filthy mouth and tolerance levels by adjusting the profanity list and the amount you penalise yourself for particular ones.
Features:
Brain tree integration
Create your own list of naughty words.
All processing is done on the device, so there is no need to worry about the NSA listening in.
Monitor your progress via the integrated web backend - both your total penalties and what swears youâ€™ve been spewing. This way, you can focus on avoiding saying the swear words you say.
