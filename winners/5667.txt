So, how to improve our youngest’ safety? How to help them decide which is the safest path to their destination? Or even better, how to watch their steps remotely?
Although this is an application for any pedestrian and/or driver located in any city, we identified the following reasons for which Detroit, initially, will be interested in this solution:
Marauder mApp is built on Javascript with Node.js, MongoDB and the Meteor Framework. This is used to create a lightweight web application that can be executed either on desktop or mobile and that can display information on real time.
To display the information the GE Predix platform is used. The project consumes four Predix microservices: User Account and Authentication, Pedestrian Planning, Public Safety and Traffic Planning. GE’s Intelligent Environment Public Safety API service provides real-time and historical images/video from each intelligent LED light installed in a city.
Alice wants to go from the University to her house late at night after a long study session. She pulls her mobile, opens Marauder mApp and enters her destination, she then decides to send a request to her friend Bob so that he can keep an eye on her journey home.
While Bob makes himself a sandwich, he gets a few pictures of Alice getting outside of the University from his home computer. Dinner in hand, he checks some images from a couple of blocks ahead of Alice. Seen everything looks fine he goes back to his dinner and starts reading a book.
Once Alice gets home she sends a last notification to Bob thanking him for his watch. Bob sees Alice has arrived home safe while brushing his teeth, turns off his application and goes to sleep.
