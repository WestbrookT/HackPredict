Both of us have grown up with skin issues, but have never really had a skincare app available to us. We wanted to change that for not only us, but for people everywhere suffering with acne.
Glow promotes you being your brightest self by practicing self-care. We focused on skincare since we saw the need in the market. A lot of people don't know the basics on having a good skin regimen, which could potentially save tons of money from preventing going to the dermatologist for a problem that could have been easily solved.
We built 'Glow' with Swift and Xcode, implemented a Quotzzy API, and designed with Sketch.
We have never used APIs, so it was our first time implementing them which made us run into some time-consuming challenges.
We are extremely proud to present a prototype that gives the judges a feel for what the app is supposed to look like and what it is supposed to accomplish.
We learned how to work under extenuating circumstances which included: 1) the time constraint and 2) a teammate leaving. We had to learn how to use resources, manage our time appropriately, and present a product we are proud to demo.
Our plans for the future include having a feature specifically for transgenders in aiding them through their transitions, giving more representation to an extremely underrepresented group.
