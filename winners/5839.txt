TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon Submission May 2015
As a musician, finding collaborators for your musical projects can be difficult and time-consuming. We use tinder's validation mechanism to show you other artists' sound clips who live in your area that have been analyzed and sorted by sentiment score. By logging in via SoundCloud oAuth, your own clips are uploaded and scored by sentiment as well for other users to see. If you and another user upvote each other's tracks, you both receive a Twilio text notification and are able to chat with each other on the matches page.
