An open source telemetry system using downhill mountain biking as an inspiration. 
Modern downhill bikes have a lot of adjustability but their performance is hard to measure. If there was a system to collect data it would be easy to make adjustments with a scientific approach. Riders could also get feedback on their riding style and line choices. It could also add to the entertainment side of things by providing realtime telemetry for spectators.
