We all hate tech support. Everybody hates going through the prompts when all you want to do is the same thing. This is where we come in. 
It's a lot of work -- but I learned heaps during this hackathon. In addition, I am REALLY proud of this hack because it is immensely useful and proves that it could be a viable product given more time. 
I am happy that we are delivering something that is a proof-of-concept, we could go much deeper. 
A lot -- It's a fun challenge.
Ideally I would like to complete this and bring it full-circle.
