Tana Pura is an audio-visual experience designed specifically for the VR medium set to a musical composition by Jonny Greenwood. Thematically, it explores the moments following death, and the transition of the soul into the afterlife. Inspirations include The Tibetan Book of the Dead and The Psychadelic Experience.
The piece is designed to be experienced in a passive manner, however each playthrough has a unique seed with subtle variations, and hidden interactions.
The title of the piece, Tana Pura, is inspired directly by an instrument in the piece called a Tanpura. Tana refers to the style of music, whereas Pura translates to "complete." The visual narrative shows an abstract evolution from dissonance to a sensation of completion.
