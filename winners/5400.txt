Pearl Hacks 2017
We are both fourth year students in the computer science department at University of Virginia. In our high level courses, there are still a large amount of students in the course. So it is hard to interact with other students. This will become handy when exam times come around or when assignments are difficult and students have little time to do it on their own.
The idea of the mobile app is to make it easier to find people that you can study with.
We used android studio to create the android application and we used the built-in emulators. For our database we used Firebase. We also used Google Maps API to use the location and map services.
Downloading and setting up Android Studio took a long time. We ran into many errors along the way. One of us had to use an actual android device to test the application. Google Maps API also took a while to setup because the latest version of Firebase required a higher version of Google Play Services than any of the emulators could handle. We had to downgrade our version of Firebase in order to use a working emulator with Google Play Services.
We are proud that we were able to create a semi-working prototype to demo despite the complications.
We learned in more detail how to use java to create an android application. We had little experience with Android development in the past.
We are hoping to be able to expand its functionality and hopefully collaborate with our university to create a fully working and convenient application for students to use. Features we may include in the future are rating systems, location parameters, integration with professor office hours, and tutoring services.
