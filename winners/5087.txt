We were inspired by open world adventure games and real world scavenger hunts. We decided to combine the two and create this game!
It is a game where the player wanders through the forest searching for various times using riddles as clues. 
We built the main game using Unity. The models were created in SketchUp and the music was composed in NoteFlight. 
We ran into challenges using the colliders and while designing the compass tool. 
We are most proud of the compass and the music. 
We learned a lot more about GUI's in Unity and just overall ease of use in the engine. 
We plan on adding different scenes with different scavengers hunts to explore.
