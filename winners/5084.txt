Dodge your enemies using headtilt controls.
Powerups are placed in the arena to kill your foes. Picking them up will automatically activate them, so there are no buttons required to play.
Picking up the powerups on the beat of the music increases your sync bonus for higher scores.
At the end of the song you score will be recorded, if you can make it that far.
