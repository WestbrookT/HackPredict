85% of the world's transactions happen via cash. 
Have you ever been to a convenience store or restaurant where they only accept cash? that comes with one of those sketchy ATMs that charges 3 dollars per transaction?
We wanted to build a hack to solve this problem
Imagine a bank account that lives on the cloud, and anyone with a smartphone around you could be an ATM that lets you withdraw and deposit cash. 
The app allows you to broadcast cash requests to nearby users, and users around you can respond to your requests. After a cash hand off, money is automatically settled on the cloud through a peer-to-peer payment service.
