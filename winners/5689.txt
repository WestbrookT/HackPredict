People are constantly on their phones, whether it is checking owl or checking snapchat. We saw the need for a game for people to interact in a fun way through the popular current fad... memeing! More specifically, we wanted to create an app so that western students could meme together in a conducive environment. 
The game is set up for IOS and is a multiplayer app. Within the group that is connected there are players, and a judge, with these positions alternating every game. There is a randomly generated pics from a database of pre-selected pictures and this picture is shown on the phones of the players. Each player has 30 seconds to write a caption for the picture before they are then submitted to the "judge" player. The judge then picks a winner. The app additionally uses location settings so that at any given location on the western campus you can use the app and meme with others around you. Additionally, weekly, there will be a leaderboard released with the top memes from that week which other people can vote on. 
While brainstorming the idea many of the specifications were hard to conceptualize, such as the decisions to pick the pictures and whether there should be one, or many devices playing at once. Additionally the members of this group had not worked with swift before so that was a learning curve we had to face. 
We are proud of our newfound introductory knowledge into IOS development as well its language, swift. 
We learned about the challenges in brainstorming and collaborating with other people to develop a product as well as the importance to use wireframes to plan out the UX layout. 
Ideally, the further implementation of the specifications of the functionality are the next steps.  Stay tuned!
