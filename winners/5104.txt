I am a part of an up-and-coming startup in Canada called OneBase.  My co-founder and I decided to enter the challenge to help the good folks in Harlem that are in similar shoes, namely, trying to connect with local entrepreneurs and turn their ideas into reality.  Both of us have been to New York City and wandered into Harlem, and we loved all of the old buildings and different restaurants.  We're hoping to win some money to help us fund our startup.
