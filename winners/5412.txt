Big Brother uses cascade classifiers for real-time facial detection and template matches for boundary detection on the baby and crib. Information about the baby is stored on an AWS EC2 instance using a mySQL database. A PHP script continuously polls the database for any changes. 
If the baby escapes, the detection system will push an SMS text message via Twilio's server. In addition, our own web app will update to show that the baby has escaped. 
Current solutions to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) are either expensive or require more hardware. Our implementation attempts to address these problems using open-source libraries for a free, robust baby-tracking experience. We also think that this could be used in hospitals/nursing homes to monitor if patients/senior citizens get up from their bed/leave the room/etc.
