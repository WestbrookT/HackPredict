The math was very difficult and attempting to rush a 3D printed design was also difficult but there was a rush because 3D printing would be a very time consuming process. 
Thus we also had to create a lot of our latter designs around the already 3D printed parts.
VuMarks were also difficult to create. VuMarks must be very easily distinguishable from each other and non-symmetric along any axis, and therefore took a while to get finely tuned and calibrated.
Finally the math was a very difficult thing to visualize. We had to go from 3D space to 2D space and there were some difficulties with projections. The coders did end up writing relatively bug-free code, but not before a long, arduous thinking process.
The two logic/algorithm gods that we had on our team solved an extremely complex math problem very quickly. 
Also our 3D printed parts are actually fire though. Just saying.
Two 5 hour energies in 72 hours is actually not as bad an idea as some might think.
Math is hard.
Norton and Thevenin Equivalents. Yikes.
