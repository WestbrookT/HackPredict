There are some days when you just can't get to the Cathedral of Learning on Tuesday. There are also some days when you're allergic to dogs. This site will allow you to get all of your therapy dog needs despite your overwhelming challenges.
You can pet Pepe and get the same feelings that you would when you are petting a therapy dog. You need to work to earn Pepe's love by petting him at a fast enough speed. If you ignore Pepe while he is on your screen, he will become sad. If you ignore him long enough, he will die but you can revive him. 
We drew a dog on paint.NET and then we drew the tail in different positions and his face with different expressions to animate it. We then put all of the images into a sprite file and then used JavaScript to scroll and loop through the file really quickly so that it looked like it was animated. Then, Natalie got all of the JavaScript to work for the actual clicking motion.
We originally attempted to use static images for every situation when the dog was not wagging his tale, but that wasn't working so we ended up looping the same image over and over again, similar to how we looped the wagging animation.
We learned how to use layers on paint.NET and how to animate using JavaScript in the style of a flipbook.
We assume that colleges and hospitals will be excited to have this easy way to give people the experience of therapy dogs without having to walk all the way to the Cathedral or on days that are not Tuesday.
