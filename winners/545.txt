To save just one life of a child is priceless.
With regards to an increased demand of independence amongst children and high child kidnapping statistics, ensuring that children are safe has become a daily necessity for parents across the globe. This has resulted in an increase of location-tracking devices within the market. As a father and with an interest in entrepreneurship, the company owner, Jason Peixoto, is prepared to guide the company to success and profitability. The Child Guardian plans to enter the growing industry by providing customers with an innovative device which will locate and track children using a notification system which supports notification alters when a child moves out of a pre-determined safety zone. This wearable device can be sown into fabric that monitors the distance a child, dog, or item of value, and can be tracked from a mobile device, pager, or monitor. The device has an advanced system called the HIVE, when a child is reported missing law enforcements can track the missing child only once the Guardian has activate the hive.
