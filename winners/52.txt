Here's the whole story:
One of our team members was born with amblyopia, a disorder similar to lazy-eye in which vision in one eye can be lost forever if not corrected at an early age. However, without the motivation or realization of risk, many young kids neglect treatment, not wanting to wear an eye patch to train their other eye. But many modern methods for education and working with children are based on the principle of gameifying a task-- making something into a game makes it more appealing and easier to enjoy by kids. That's why we decided to help kids with amblyopia overcome their condition by leveraging Oculus Rift virtual reality gaming technology.
When our group of four walked into the Hackerspace, one of us had been using Unity for merely a week and the other three had minimal to no experience. By the time we finished our project, we had all mastered an area of the Unity workflow, from Design to Programming to Gameplay. Our execution was meticulously organized and planned from the beginning: From our time planned to the minute to our roles divided among expertise, we created a strong collaborative sense of team synergy that bolstered our productivity and made for effective performance.
Despite the amount of work that we've put in, our creation is a prototype. It's by no means a finished product, but rather a proof-of-concept. However, we seriously plan on continuing development on this project in the near future-- replacing simple geometric bodies with actual art assets, adding more mini-games and levels, improving functionality, and continuing to tune and balance gameplay. We feel confident that this product will provide an easy but extremely effective way to solve a serious problem in today's children in a way that is enjoyable and immensely beneficial.
