Wishbnb is a website and mobile app to help terminally ill children go on their dream vacation while they still can with their families. When the child likes several photos and pins them to our board, our AI analyzes the selections and picks out a top destination based on trends in the photos. Airbnb suggestions also populate with hotels and homes for the visit with their parents. From there, the listing is crowdfunded by the community so the parents do not incur any expenses and can have a much-deserved vacation. This inclusive web app helps kids in need and reminds us to not take our youth, travel, and families for granted.
I was inspired to make this app after the experiences my family went through with my younger sister Sydney. She has two chronic illnesses and it was so hard to see her so sick in the hospital. We told her she could have anything she wanted because we so desperately wanted to see a smile on her face. She asked for a puppy so we got her Diva the Diabetes Dog. I wanted to create Wishbnb for the families who aren't as well off and want to bring joy to the lives of their very special children.
We one day hope to see our project available in children's hospitals across the globe. Wishbnb works on almost every device with Web, iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile Releases. Our website is live and fully functional. I'm hoping to reach out several children's charities like Make a Wish and JDRF to see if they'd be interested in partnering with Wishbnb. We also plan to expand the list of available destinations. Currently the AI can distinguish between 5 suggested tourism destinations but our current implementation is fully scalable and can work with as many destinations as we could give it.
