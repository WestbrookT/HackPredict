Nearly all of us on the team play either guitar, ukulele, or both. Always when learning a new song, it is bothersome to stop playing to scroll to the next part, but as beginners, we cannot use the auto-scroll function on many apps which goes at one speed automatically and does not listen to the user. We fixed the issue by scrolling based on data from the user (when chords played are matching)
After finding the song, users can learn learn at their own speed with the autoscroll listening to their chords, while also testing for accuracy of chords as the lyrics will not move on until to chords is played correctly.
