We started Frame as a solution to the problem we had a previous company -- we couldn't deliver our video processing Windows app to other devices (like Macs or tablets), and the app required high-end graphics card to run. We tried other solutions (like Citrix, VMware, OnLive...) but none of them worked well. That's when we decided to build our own platform and started a company. 
Apps on Frame don't work great when bandwidth is very low (under 1Mbps). With current standard cable or cellular connections, Frame already runs great for up to 1080p -- faster connection means lower latency and better user experience. With Gigabit networks, we can deliver on the full promise of the cloud and decouple where the app runs (the cloud) from where you access it (your device). We call this ubiquitous computing -- infinite power, anywhere, on any device. 
We got some of the world's largest companies, like Adobe and Siemens, to use our technology and Frame Platform to deliver their apps from the cloud.
For Gighacks, we optimized our platform to run with super-HD resolutions (above 1080p). Max resolution that Frame now supports is 2560x1600! We also improved our audio-video (AV) sync so that apps like Adobe Premier Pro can run smoothly on 4K monitors.
