In the age of the Internet, memes have become a cultural phenomenon that impact and influence every aspect of our society. The meme has become the language of the millennial, and the easiest way to relate and communicate with young people. They're a source of comic relief and brutal honesty for a generation plagued by disparity and distrust. As millennials ourselves, we understand that the amount of memes circulating the Internet can often be overwhelming and difficult to keep up with. Some even strive in desperation to know every meme. We can only imagine the strife that clueless parents deal with when their children start talking about random Internet trends as well. Meme Dictionary is designed to help.
Meme Dictionary is a website currently designed to provide information about memes and catalog popular Internet memes for people to view online. By creating a database of popular memes, it will be easier for parents to understand what the f**k their kids are talking about all the time, and also for meme savvy young people to stay on trend and up to date with the latest memes.
We used HTML and CSS to create the Meme DIctionary website.
Embedding audio and video files within the website's homepage.
Adding a star ranking system to rank how dank each meme in the dictionary is.
As beginners to web development, we learned a lot about basic HTML and CSS in general. The project was a wonderful way to introduce us to web development while addressing an issue we are passionate about.
