Help women to be inspired by what other women are doing to promote gender equality and find other women who has similar experience

We used primarily python to scrape tweets from several twitter accounts. Then used a JSON thesaurus to generate word scores for each tweet and store them in a database, where we can search for words similar to what the user is looking for.
Words have different meanings in different contexts, so a lot of quotes seem like odd fits for the given input.
The quote word-scores are, in some cases, surprisingly powerful. They can come up with tweets that fit inputs where we wouldn't expect to find anything.
