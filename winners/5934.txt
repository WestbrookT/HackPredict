We were thinking about inconveniences we face during school, and one idea that came up was speech memorization.
Oratory helps the user memorize a given speech.
We used Android Studio, Google speech-to-text API, and Classifer4J Summarizer API.
Putting it all together and transitioning between reading to summarization to memorization were the main points of difficulty.
The whole app ended up working the way we envisioned it.
We learned how to use speech-to-text API, Classifer4J Summarizer API and tricks with Android UI.
Oratory plans on having implementation of multiple languages, better speech recognition, and a more personalized experience with machine learning.
