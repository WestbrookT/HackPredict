We are interested in augmented reality and hope to use this technology help make people's life easier.
The app recognizes pictures of art works, famous people, and regular items and displays information about them.
We used the Vuforia SDK to implement augmented reality related functionalities, and used Unity to build the 3D environment.
Sometimes it didn't recognize the image, and the position/interactive functionality used not to work.
It's really cool.
We've got new knowledge on augmented reality development and learned how to use Unity and Vuforia.
Hopefully it will have a more generalized image recognition and people will use it to display actual data about items detected.
