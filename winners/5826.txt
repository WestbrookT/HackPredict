Spotify and ESRI API cloud service and map integration. 
I had in mind using firebase as data layer because it is simply fast and easy to use but I came into roadblocks because of the complex querying requirements of this project : it was doable using firebase, but would result in too much data transfer and processing on the client side given the query limitations of firebase's geofire api. ERSI has the perfect combination of spatial querying and grouping and it is all done server side.
