You can select a UNC major – I only had time to load 4 in from our academic worksheets -- add individual classes, or upload a unique course list as a text file -- which makes the app usable for students at other universities. Once uploaded, you can drag classes to other semesters or delete them all together. It’s also mobile friendly!
I spent about 3 hours trying to load in local text files – one for each major at Carolina – and I couldn’t get it to accept the files, so I had to make an array in the css page for each major. 
I am really proud of how I was able to get the file upload to work and that I got the classes to drag from one semester to the next. Overall, I would have never guessed I could have done this in one day, so thank you Pearl Hacks for the motivation! 
I learned that JavaScript is so much simpler than Java!! It took me so much longer to do the same thing in Java, implementing model-view-controller, but with JavaScript I didn’t have to make class objects, I could just create divs and load text into them! I can’t wait to use JavaScript more!
I want to have all the courses put into a JSON file so I can add elements to them like difficulty – which would be cool to crowd source – so that students can balance the difficulty of their semesters.
