We were inspired by games such as Lifeline, a text-based survival game, and the movie The Princess Bride.
This games takes the user on an incredible journey as the protagonists. 
We built this game using HTML and CSS, after creating a wire-frame-like flowchart to plan our game.
We plan on making our game much more complex and interactive for the user as well as make the user interface design much more appealing.
