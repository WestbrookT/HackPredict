Everyone gets tired waiting for their large downloads to complete. BitTorrent is awesome, but you may not have a bunch of peers ready to seed it. Fastify, a download accelerator as a service, solves both these problems and regularly enables 4x download speeds. 
We even cache some downloads so popular downloads will be able to be pulled from Fastify even speedier!
Without any cache hits, we saw the following improvements in download speeds with our test files:
test was performed with slices of the ubuntu 16.04 iso file, on the eduroam network
Created an AWS cluster and began writing Go code to accept requests and the front-end to send them. Over time we added more workers to the AWS cluster and improved the front-end. Also, we generously received some well-needed Vitamin Water. 
We're able to accelerate large downloads by 2-5 times as fast as the regular download. That's only with a cluster of 4 computers. 
Bittorrent is tricky. James can't be trusted. 
More servers on the cluster. Demo soon too.
